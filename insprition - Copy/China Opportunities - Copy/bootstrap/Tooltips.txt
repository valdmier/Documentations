Tooltips:
note:tooltips could be used with almost any html item

Tooltips is like a notifiction that ppers when you hover

but to make this thing really work..make sure that you put this in the script file:


$(function () {
    $('[data-toggle="tooltip"]').tooltip()
  })


---
lets get started with an example:

<button class="btn btn-primary" data-toggle="tooltip"  data-placement="right" title="So you have put the js code to be able to see me(::!!">Hover on me</button>


the data-toggle: is to tell bootstrap that this is a Tooltip.

data placment: to tell bootstrap in witch side the tooltip should be palced in(left,top..etx).

the tittle: is to tell bootstrap what should be written in the tooltip.
