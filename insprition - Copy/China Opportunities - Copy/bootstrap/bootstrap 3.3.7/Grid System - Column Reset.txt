if an element came on an element and the bigger element covered the small element ..then you should use:

clearfix to separate them 


example:

<div>i am covering it</div>


<div class="clearfix"> </div>//haha i will separate them


<div> noo im under him ..u cant see me</div>



note :i couldnt do a real example bit if it ever happend to ypu do it like that^^
