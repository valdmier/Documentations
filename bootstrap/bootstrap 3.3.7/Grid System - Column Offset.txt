well the offset is like margin but here u cant tell him to 

put margin from the left or the right ...he allways put 

margin from the left side of element  you have chosen 


offset is kinda like push cuz they both push the element 

from its left side towards the right .. but the diffrent is 

that offset is like real margin like the space the margin 

takes like if there where a real element there..

 but push and pull is just putting stuff some wehere


.os {
    
    background-color: red;
    color: w1ite;
  margin: 3px;

}

<div class="container">
    <div class="row">
    
     
         <div class="col-lg-2 col-lg-offset-3">    <div class="os">1</div>   </div>
         

<div class="col-lg-2 col-lg-offset-">    <div class="os">2</div>   </div>
       
    

      
         

        
    </div>
