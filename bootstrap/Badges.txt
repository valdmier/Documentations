to make Badges:

 <div class="col-4">
    
 <h4 class="lead">Rating <span class="badge badge-warning ">4.7</span></h4>
    </div>
===
or to make the corners rounded:

 <h4 class="lead">Rating <span class="badge badge-warning badge-pill">4.7</span></h4>

===
to add an icon:

 <h4 class="lead">Rating <span class="badge badge-warning badge-pill">4.7</span></h4>
===
important note:Using the contextual .badge-* classes on an <a> element quickly provide actionable badges with hover and focus states.

to make it a link instead of span:

 <h4 class="lead">Jobs<a href="#" class="badge badge-light">Light</a></h4>
