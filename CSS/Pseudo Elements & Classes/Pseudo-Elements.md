# CSS Pseudo-Elements Documentation

Pseudo-elements in CSS extend the capability of selectors by allowing you to style parts of an element rather than the whole element. They are denoted by a double colon `::` followed by the pseudo-element name. This documentation covers various pseudo-elements and their applications.

**NOTE:** Pseudo-elements use `::`.

## Introduction to Pseudo-Elements

Pseudo-elements target specific parts of an element, such as the first line or first letter. They are used to apply styles to portions of an element's content rather than the element itself.

### Example of Using Pseudo-Elements:

```css
p::first-line {
  font-weight: bold; /* Styles the first line of a paragraph */
}
```

## Common Pseudo-Elements

### `::before`

The `::before` pseudo-element inserts content before the actual content of an element. It is often used for decorative purposes.

```css
p::before {
  content: "‚Üí "; /* Adds an arrow before each paragraph */
}
```

### `::after`

The `::after` pseudo-element inserts content after the actual content of an element. Like `::before`, it is used for decorative purposes.

```css
p::after {
  content: " ‚Üê"; /* Adds an arrow after each paragraph */
}
```

### `::first-line`

The `::first-line` pseudo-element selects the first line of a block-level element and allows styling specifically for that line.

```css
p::first-line {
  font-weight: bold; /* Styles the first line of each paragraph */
}
```

### `::first-letter`

The `::first-letter` pseudo-element selects the first letter of a block-level element and allows styling specifically for that letter.

```css
p::first-letter {
  font-size: 150%; /* Increases the font size of the first letter in each paragraph */
}
```

### `::selection`

The `::selection` pseudo-element selects the portion of text that is currently being selected by the user.

```css
::selection {
  background-color: yellow; /* Changes the background color of selected text */
  color: black; /* Changes the text color of selected text */
}
```

## Specific Use Cases

### Styling the First Letter

```css
p::first-letter {
  font-size: 150%;
  color: darkred;
}
```

### Adding Decorative Content Before Headings

```css
h2::before {
  content: "üîç ";
}
```

### Styling the Selected Text

```css
::selection {
  background-color: #7fd5f1;
  color: #1a1a1a;
}
```
