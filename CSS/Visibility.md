## Characteristics of `visibility` Property Values

### `visible`

- **Element Is Visible:** Elements with `visibility: visible;` are displayed and visible on the web page.

- **Occupies Space:** Visible elements occupy space in the layout. Other elements consider them in the document flow.

- **Interactive:** Interactive elements can be interacted with, such as clicking links or form elements.

### `hidden`

- **Element Is Hidden:** Elements with `visibility: hidden;` are hidden from view but still exist in the layout structure.

- **Occupies Space:** Hidden elements continue to occupy space in the layout, affecting the positioning of other elements.

- **Interactive:** Elements with `visibility: hidden;` remain interactive. You can interact with them as if they are visible, such as clicking links or form elements.

## Comparing `visibility` to `display: none;`

- The `visibility` property hides elements while retaining their layout impact, meaning they still occupy space in the layout.

- In contrast, `display: none;` removes elements from the layout entirely, and they don't occupy any space.

- Elements with `visibility: hidden;` are interactive, while elements with `display: none;` are not.

- Use `visibility` when you want to hide an element temporarily without altering the layout. Use `display: none;` when you want to completely remove an element from the layout.

## Conclusion

The CSS `visibility` property is a useful tool for controlling the visibility of elements on web pages. By choosing between `visible` and `hidden` values, you can control whether an element is displayed or hidden while considering its impact on the layout and interactivity. Understanding the differences between `visibility` and `display` properties is important for designing web pages that offer a seamless user experience.
