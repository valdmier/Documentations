## CSS Keyframes Documentation

### Keyframes Overview

CSS keyframes are a powerful feature that allows developers to create animations by defining a series of styles at different points in time. This enables smooth transitions between various states, providing a visually engaging and dynamic user experience.

```css
@keyframes animationName {
  0% {
    /* Styles at the starting keyframe */
  }
  50% {
    /* Styles at the middle keyframe */
  }
  100% {
    /* Styles at the ending keyframe */
  }
}
```

- **animationName:** A unique name assigned to the keyframes, used later when applying the animation to an element.

- **0%, 50%, 100%:** Percentage values represent the progression of the animation, where 0% is the starting point, 50% is the midpoint, and 100% is the ending point.

### Keyframes Property

The `animation` property is used to apply keyframes to an element. It specifies the name of the animation, duration, timing function, delay, and iteration count.

```css
.element-animate {
  animation: animationName 2s ease-in-out 0.5s infinite alternate;
}
```

- **animationName:** The name of the keyframes defined using `@keyframes`.

- **2s:** Duration of the animation, in seconds.

- **ease-in-out:** Timing function, determining the acceleration of the animation over time.

- **0.5s:** Delay before the animation starts, in seconds.

- **infinite:** Number of times the animation should repeat. Here, it repeats indefinitely.

- **alternate:** Animation direction, reversing on every iteration.

### Usage Examples

#### Simple Animation

```css
@keyframes fadeIn {
  0% {
    opacity: 0;
  }
  100% {
    opacity: 1;
  }
}

.element-fade {
  animation: fadeIn 1.5s ease-in-out;
}
```

In this example, the `fadeIn` animation gradually increases the opacity of the element from 0% to 100% over 1.5 seconds.

#### Bouncing Animation

```css
@keyframes bounce {
  0%, 20%, 50%, 80%, 100% {
    transform: translateY(0);
  }
  40% {
    transform: translateY(-20px);
  }
  60% {
    transform: translateY(-10px);
  }
}

.element-bounce {
  animation: bounce 1s infinite;
}
```

The `bounce` animation creates a bouncing effect by translating the element on the Y-axis at various keyframes, resulting in a lively animation.

### Conclusion

CSS keyframes provide a versatile mechanism for creating animations in web development. By defining a series of styles at different points in time, developers can achieve fluid and captivating motion effects. Understanding the syntax and usage of keyframes, along with the application through the `animation` property, enables the creation of engaging and interactive user interfaces.
