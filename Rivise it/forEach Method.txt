The forEach() method execute the function once for each element in an array, in order.

the means it takes every element of the array n enter it in the function as an argumnet and excute the function
===
example:

const willBePrinted = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

function print(Num) {
    console.log(Num);
}

willBePrinted.forEach(print)

===
there is a short cut without of having to name the function :

const willBePrinted = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

willBePrinted.forEach(function (Num) {
    console.log(Num);
})

===
forEach with Arrow functions:

let ss = willBePrinted.forEach((Num) => (
    console.log(Num)
))

console.log(ss)
