in css when when want to nest an element with certen class if it was inside a certen element we do:
   

<p> hi <span class = "className"> mohammed </span> 
    alsolimani  </p> 

p .className{
    
    color: aquamarine;
    
}


result the name mohammed changed

well in sass its a different thing 

how we do this in sass?:


well you can do the same thing or you can do it like that 

<p>hi <span class = "className"> mohammed </span> 
    alsolimani  </p> 

p {
    color: orangered;
    
    .className {
    color: aquamarine;
    }
    
}

n it will do the same thing but the rest of the paragraph will be red cuz i commanded that.

and like that you put the parent and the child...or a child inside a child...its much easier here



but how if i wanted to use some properties like pesudo classrs or element?:


p {
    color: orangered;
    
    .className {
    color: aquamarine;
    }
         &:hover {
        background-color:darkorchid;
        
    }
        
    }


we refer to the main parent with the "$" sign
