The difference between this property and the 

document.documentElement property, is that the 

document.body element returns the <body> element,

while the document.documentElement returns the <html> 

element.



What is the purpose of document.documentElement?

document.documentElement: returns the documentElement

 of a document, as an Element object. For HTML 

documents the returned object is the HTML element. It

 returns the Element that is the root element of the

 document (for example, the <html> element for HTML 
documents).


What is the purpose of document.body?

document.body is the element that contains the content 
for the document. In documents with <body> contents, 
returns the <body> element, and in frameset documents, 
this returns the outermost <frameset> element.


What is the effect of setting the document.body?


Though body is settable, setting a new body on a 
document will effectively remove all the current 

children of the existing <body> element.


What may be the cause for document.body to be null or 
undefined?


If you are experiencing a problem where document.body 
is null or undefined, check your JavaScript code to 
make sure that your JavaScript code is only executed 
after the DOM is fully loaded. If your JavaScript code 
is located in the head section of the page, move your 
JavaScript code into the body section of the page as 
recommended for performance reason. If the problem 
goes away, then your JavaScript code (when it was in 
the head section) was being executed before the DOM is 

fully loaded. Browser parses your html from top down, 
your script runs before body is loaded. To fix put 
script just before the closing body tag.
