The e is short for event

The simplest way to create an event is to click somewhere
 on the page.

When you click, a click event is triggered. This event is
 actually an object containing information about the action
 that just happened.

note: u could just right event instead of e
===
<form id="myForm" action="/action_page.php">
    <input type="text" name="" id="" placeholder="Username">
    <input type="text" name="" id="" placeholder="Password">
  <button type="submit">submit</button>
  </form>

document.getElementById("myForm").addEventListener("submit", 
function(e) {
    alert("submited!");
    e.preventDefault();
});

n that means when the event occrs stop the action of the form
(witch is the default behavior) n dont take us nowehre
