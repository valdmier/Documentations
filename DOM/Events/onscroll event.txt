onscroll is an event that happens when the browser is scrrolling:

simple example:


window.onscroll = function () {
    
    "use strict";
    
    var alrert = alert("dont scroll too much theres nothing there");
    
    return alrert;
      
};

another example:


div {
  border: 1px solid black;
  width: 200px;
  height: 100px;
  overflow: scroll;
}


p>Try the scrollbar in div.</p>

<div onscroll="myFunction()">In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since.
<br><br>
'Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,' he told me, just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had.'</div>

<p id="demo"></p>



function myFunction() {
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "You scrolled in div.";
}
