so the inner width n height:

 count the document like if u open the console it will 

be smaller cuz it only count the page onlyy not the

 url bar not the scroll bar just the document onlyy.


the outer width:

in counts the scroll,the menu bar evey thing exept the url bar, n everything else.

lets try it out


example:


//so if what we said was true..then the outer height n width must be more than than the inner height nwidth always



window.console.log("thats inner height: " + window.innerHeight + " px n that inner height: " + window.innerWidth + " px n that outer height: " + window.outerHeight + " px n thats outer width :" + window.outerWidth + " px ");


result: 

thats inner height: 754 px n that inner height: 1156 px n that outer height: 824 px n thats outer width :1536 px
