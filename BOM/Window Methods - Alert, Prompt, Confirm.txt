alert:

u always had that warning in brackets when u use alert right?so how do u fix that?by define it as variable?

that fixes it but the best way is to say:

window.alert("bla bla");
n
window.prombt("bla bla");
n
window.console.log("bla bla");
n
window.confirm("do u want to bla bla");

but an alert will disterb yr users if used it as notifiction

cuz the alert will unable them to press anything unless they pressed ok ...an what if they had to many
they';; have to press ok a million time

confirm:


its way to warn the user n ask him if he's sure n if he want continue


example:

var ask = window.confirm("r u sure u want to visit google ?");


if(ask === true){
    
    window.location.href = "https://www.google.com"; 
} else {
    
    window.alert("canceld")
    
}

prombt

prombt is way to give the user a text bar to write in an u can make an if statment like if he said winter then give him cold n stuff luke that

syntax:

pronbt("write here the qustion u want to ask the user about", "here we mostly give the user an example of what should he write like if u asked him bout his name give him a name here as an example" 


example:

var ask = window.prompt("are u more like poor or rich"),

    asked = ask.toLowerCase().trim();

if (asked === "rich") {
    
    window.alert("wow then u or ur dad worked hard then");
} else if (asked === "poor") {
    
    window.alert("then u have to work hard n spend less n invisiment");
    
}
