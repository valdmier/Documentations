href is way to put the location of the page on some part of the page:

window.console.log(location.href);

n it will show the page url

===
thats how u get a url but to set it:

location.href = "https//www.google.com";


===

but u can set other stuff like:

the id n it will take u to it

   <div id = "div3"> hi</div>
     <div id = "div2"> hi</div>


div {
    color:lightblue;
    height: 600px;

    
}



write that in the console n it will take to it:

location.href = "#div2";
