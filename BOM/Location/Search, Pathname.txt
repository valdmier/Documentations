or this 

https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml5_button_formaction

or this

https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_pre


what do this three have in common?

the question mark "?" one of things in common right?

well eveything after that question mark is the search n u can bring it by the search property

but before than know that the main pages dont have a search just the secondry pages in the pages

now lets pring the search:

we wanna take the search of this link:


https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_pre


write in the console:


location.search



result:

"?filename=tryhtml_pre"


===

pathname:

the path name is between the website name and the 

question mark "?" 
                          
https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?
                         ^     between ^
filename=tryhtml_pre

ok enough talking

example:


this link:

https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_pre


go to console write: location.pathname


result:

"/tags/tryit.asp"
