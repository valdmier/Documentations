if you put a variable inside a function:


var calcInches = function(startAge, endAge,
inchesPerYear){

var totalInches = inchesPerYear * (endAge
 - startAge);

return totalInches;
};



 
it will be a local variable
and if u use it out of function it won't 
work

a global variable is out of  the function
and u can use it anywhere

serch more for that concept
