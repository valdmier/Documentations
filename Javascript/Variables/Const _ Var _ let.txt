let can be only available inside the scope it's declared, like in for loop

you can't redeclare variables with let:

let cats=5;
let cats=6;

console.log(cats);
-
output: Eror: Identifier 'cats' has already been declared

but you can update it:

let cats = 5;
cats = 6;

console.log(cats);
-
output: 6

note: it could be updated and redeclared inside functions and whats similar to it
