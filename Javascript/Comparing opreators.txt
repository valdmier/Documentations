Comparing Operators:

they are operators that compares between values.

---

bigger/lesser than(><):

example:

console.log(3 < 4);
-
output: true


===
bigger/lesser than or equal(<= =>):

example:

console.log(3 => 4);
-
output: false

equaling oprerators:
we have three equaling oprerators signs


(=)this called assignment Operator wich means
يعني زي الللي يوقع على قيم المتغيرات او الفيريلز ..

it mostly use with variables and giving them vaules

we dont use for comparison we just give values 
with it
 

====

(==)this called the comparison operator

this one u could use for comparing numbers or 
strings it doesnt matter whats the data type
if there is number it will compare no matter what


example:


lucifer = "30";

if (lucifer == 30){
    
    alert("good");
    
    
}
    else {
alert("bad");


}


the result will be good

 even though we did
equaled a string to a number so the comparison 
operator doesnt care for the data type


===


(===) this code called identical operator

the defrence between identical operator(===) and 
comparison operator(==) is that the first(===) care 
for data types but the second(==) nahh


example:

var lucifer = "30";

if (lucifer === 30) {
    
    alert("good");
    
    
}
    else {
alert("bad");


}


the result will be bad cuz (===) is sensitve for 
the type of thee data you enter n string n number
arent the same



another example:


var lucifer = "30";

if (lucifer === 30) {
    
    alert("good");
    
    
}
    else {
alert("bad");


}


the result will be good cuz (===) is sensitve for 
the type of thee data you enter n number n number
they r the sameript.

 
===


= is used for
 assigning values to a variable in JavaScript. 

== is used for
 comparison between two variables irrespective of
 the datatype of variable.

=== is used for 
comparision between two variables but this will 
check strict type, which means it will check 
datatype and compare two values.


===

(!=)this called the Inequality operator

this one u could use for comparing numbers or 
strings it doesnt matter whats the data type
if there is number it will compare no matter what


example:

var lucifer = "29";

if (lucifer != 30) {

    alert("good");


}
else {
    alert("bad");


}
===

(!==)this called the Strict inequality operator

the defrence between Strict inequality operator(!==) and 
inequality operator(!=) is that the first(!==) care 
for data types but the second(!=) nahh

example:

var lucifer = "30";

if (lucifer !== 30) {

    alert("good");


}
else {
    alert("bad");


}
