Destructuring :

The destructuring assignment syntax is a JavaScript 
expression that makes it possible to store values from 
arrays, or properties from objects, into
variables.

===
example with arrays:

var race = ["sami","Amanda","sara", "Naser", "ali"];

const [first, second, theird] = race;

console.log("1: " +first + " 2: " + second + " 3: " + theird); 

//RESULT: 1: sami 2: Amanda 3: sara

===
Object destructuring:

const user = {
    id: 42,
    is_verified: true
};

const {id, is_verified} = user;
