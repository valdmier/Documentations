Arrays:

array is a way to store things

===
There are two ways to write arrays

The Constructor Array 

var friends = new array();
frends[0] = "mohaned";
frends[1] = "majed"; 
frends[2] = "me";

or 

var friends = new array(

   " yousef ",
   " zyad ",
   " bonn bonn "


);


this way isnt quite right..you wont need it now


---


the normal array:


var myFriends = ["mohaned", "majed", "me",
 "bonn bonn", "mazen"];

so if we wanted to call mohanad:

text( myFriends[0], 10, 30);

not cuz he is the first one we write
 1 no we start from zero 

  calling mazen:

text( myFriends[4], 10, 40);

===

how to check if this vaiable is array or not:

var friends = ["mohammed", "ali", "nader"];


if (Array.isArray(friends)) {


    alert("its an array");

} else {
    
    
    alert("it aint an array");
}


the result will be its an array


---
another way to check

var friends = ["mohammed", "ali", "nader"];


if (friends.constructor === Array) {


    alert("its an array");

} else {
    
    
    alert("it aint an array");
}



the result will be its an array


===
big mistake:


var myFriends = ["mohaned", "majed", "me",
 "bonn bonn", "mazen"];

if u wrote your array like that it wiil be good

but if you added a couma to the last item like

var myFriends = ["mohaned", "majed", "me",
 "bonn bonn", "mazen,"];

thats a real mistake 

n in some browser that wont work so take care of 
that




===

using loops with arrys:

so here is my friends

var myFriends = ["mohaned", "majed", "me",
 "bonn bonn", "mazen"];
text(myFriends[0], 10, 30);

text(myFriends[1], 10, 78);

text(myFriends[2], 10, 130);

text(myFriends[3], 10, 182);

n here is our questions
1. What do I want to repeat?
 

  the text() command
 

2. What do I want to change each time?

  the friend num, and the y position
 

3. How long should we repeat?
 

  until there are no more friends left

//to make everything adebends on it


var friendNum = 0;
          //3answer 
//that mean as long as friendnum variable
is less than my friends run this..

comment replay:
.length` is a property of JS arrays.
 You use it in statements like
 _arrayName_`

.length` This will return the
 number of elements in the given array.
 In the code at the end of the video,
 on line 11,

 Pamela has the code `myFriends.

length` This evaluates to 6 because there
 are six elements in the `myFriends` array.

 You can test this by pausing the video and
 typing `println(myFriends.length);` at the
 end of the code.

*/

while(friendNum < myFriends.length)

//now we add the caliing so they can show up
{
text(myFriends[friendNum], 10, friendNum);


//so he add one each time and call them all
n stop runing it when he rich 4 

friendNum++;
}

if not understood

but hey she wont explain the length thing
so foucas on my explaning


to make a text or an ellipse moves by mouse
clicking here we call a balloon made by
line n ellipse and by the array we will 
make two of them with out having to repeat
it it n then make a thired if the user 
cliced it will show up:


var xPositions = [100, 200];


var draw = function(){

//just one n chnge its place each time:
if (mouseIsPressed) {

xPositions[2] = mouseX;
}


//if i want to make a lot of them:
if (mouseIsPressed) 
{xPositions.push(mouseX);
}

//push:

Add a new item to an array:

var fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
fruits.push("Kiwi");

*/

for (var i = 0; i < xPositions.length; i++){
line(xPositions[i], 120, 194, 285);

ellipse(xPositions[i], 104, 32, 46);

    }
  

how to draw winston as much as u want by 
object n loop or array :

var drawWinston = function(faceX, faceY){
fill(255, 255, 0);

ellipse(faceX, faceY, 300, 300);
 // face


fill(46, 46, 41);
ellipse(faceX - 45, faceY - 57, 40, 40);
 // eyes


ellipse(faceX + 102, faceY - 66, 40, 40);


fill(252, 65, 65);

ellipse(faceX + 55, faceY + 32, 120, 136); // mouth
    

fill(46, 46, 41);

ellipse(faceX - 45, faceY - 57, 40, 40);
 // eyes
    

ellipse(faceX + 102, faceY - 66, 40, 40);
    

fill(252, 65, 65);

ellipse(faceX + 55, faceY + 32, 120, 136);
 // mouth
}

//repeating the drawing by ararrys n loop:

var xPositions = [99, 294, 101,  294, 10, 1,
10]

;
var yPositions = [117, 117, 316, 316, 1, 1,
 1];


for (var i = 0; i < xPositions.length; i++){


drawWinston(xPositions[i], yPositions[i]);


}

and if you add a new number to the y n x 
array positions it will show up a new 
winston

but an array here is a little messy n 
confusing

//repeating the drawing by objects n loops:

var positions = [
  
{x: 99, y: 117},

{x: 294, y: 117},

{x: 101, y: 316},

{x: 294, y: 316}
  
];
for (var i = 0; i < positions.length; i++){


drawWinston(positions[i].x,
 positions[i].y);


}

n its more readable
