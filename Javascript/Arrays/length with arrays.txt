length with strings:


if used lenth with a string it will count it letters
n tell you how many leters there r(space is considered
a letter) 
numbers

---
example:

var myString = "blaBla";
console.log(myString.length);

the result
 will be 6 cuz there are 6 letters in the string

--
or we could say:

var me = "Mohammed"

console.log(me[3]);


the result:

a
===

using length with arrays:


length will count the number of items in the array 

---
example:

ar myArray = ["idk", "bonn bon", "zyad", "idk"];
console.log(myArray.length);

the result will be 4..cuz there r 4 items in the array 

--
or we could say:

var myArray = ["idk", "bonn bon", "zyad", "idk"];

console.log(myArray[2]);


the result:

zyad


===
calling array counting &length counting differences:

lenth counting: well when put a lenght u start
 counting from 1

array counting: but when call an array like :

myExample[0]

u start counting from 0 not from 1 like length

n thats the difference

===

changing the lenth of array:

so we have this array:

var coolArray = ["bonnBonn", "food", "wealth",
 "health"];

its length = 4

if we want to change the length of it for some reason

we could say:

var coolArray = ["bonnBonn", "food", "wealth",
 "health"];

coolArray.length = 2;

console.log(coolArray);

n the result will be:

["bonnBonn", "food"]
