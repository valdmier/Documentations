length:

its easy there is to way to put add items with length

example:
1-
var myArray = ["idk", "bonn bon", "zyad", "idk"];

myArray[4] = "me";

console.log(myArray);


the result will be

["idk", "bonn bon", "zyad", "idk", "me"]

---
2-
var myArray = ["idk", "bonn bon", "zyad", "idk"];

myArray[myArray.length] = "me";

console.log(myArray);


the result will be

["idk", "bonn bon", "zyad", "idk", "me"]



but why did we puted length ?cuz the index number that the array use it will be always be more by one  

 

note: you might see a result saying Array(5)

...just refresh the page

push()

its the obese of pop

always puting item in the end of the array..even if
u added another name it will always stay the last one

var myArray = ["idk", "bonn bon", "zyad", "idk"];

myArray.push("myWife");

console.log(myArray);



the result will be:

["idk", "bonn bon", "zyad", "idk", "myWife"]




note: you might see a result saying Array(5)

unshift()


the obese of shift cuz it deletes n that adds

always puting item in the beginning of the array..
even if u added another name it will always stay at
beginning of the array


var myArray = ["idk", "bonn bon", "zyad", "idk", 
"nobody"];

myArray.unshift("myWife");

console.log(myArray);



note: you might see a result saying Array(5)

splice()

here you can delete things add things select the 
number u wanna -for deleting see the deleting document- 


syntax: arraName.

splice(from what num u want to satar deleting, how many items to delete after the num u choose, nem item,"add new item " )



var myArray = ["idk", "bonn bon", "zyad", "idk"];  
  
myArray.splice(2, 1, "app");

window.console.log(myArray);


the result will be:
["idk", "bonn bon", "app", "idk"]

so we told him delete on item after 2
