coveting array to string :


---- 


join()
 

i think join id the best wat to convert array to 
string why?


cuz its simple n you can choose what should he put 
between each item and the other


example:

note: here i make him put 11 between each item and the
 other ..you can put spaces if u want or any thing


var myArray = ["idk", "bonn bon", "zyad", "idk"];
console.log(myArray.join(" 11 "));

n the result will be: idk 11 bonn bon 11 zyad 11 idk

n thats pretty much it

toString() 

aa its like join but you cant put something betwwen
 each item n the other even if u tried to put 
something in the bracekts...

example:

var myArray = ["idk", "bonn bon", "zyad", "idk"];
console.log(myArray.toString());


the result will be:

idk,bonn bon,zyad,idk


note:he puts couma by default just.




===
toLocaleString()


it the same like toString() but that one covert it to
local srtring not global like toString()

example :
var myArray = ["idk", "bonn bon", "zyad", "idk"];
console.log(myArray.toLocaleString());



the result will be:

idk,bonn bon,zyad,idk


note:he puts couma by default just.



didnt realy much understand how it works

but if u do search buddy n add it here
