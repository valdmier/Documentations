to convert as on item :

var myString = "iam in love with javascript ",
  

        splitedString = myString.split(); 


          console.log(splitedString);

the result:

         ["iam in love with javascript "]
                   //one item



---


to make the spliter is the the space between evey

item and the other 

var myString = "iam in love with javascript ",

  
        splitedString = myString.split(" "); 


           console.log(splitedString);

the result:

     ["iam", "in", "love", "with", "javascript"]

---

and u can make the spliter a letter or any thing

here we will put the word and as the spliter:



var myString = "iam  and in and love and with and 
javascript",
  
        splitedString = myString.split("and"); 



               console.log(splitedString);


the result:


["iam  ", " in ", " love ", " with ", " javascript"]


---

theres is also a way to tell him how many items

he should show:



var myString = "iam in love with javascript",
  
           
    splitedString = myString.split(" ", 4);  


                  console.log(splitedString);



the result:

["iam", "in", "love", "with"]

so he just showed the first 4 items
