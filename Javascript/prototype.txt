All JavaScript objects like arrays n strings have properties
 and there methods from a prototype object.

Prototype Inheritance

All JavaScript objects inherit properties and methods from a prototype:

    Date objects inherit from Date.prototype
    Array objects inherit from Array.prototype
    Person objects inherit from Person.prototype


warning: Only modify your own prototypes. Never modify
 the prototypes of standard JavaScript objects.
