while loops:


if we want to repeat something with
difrent parameters:

before i we do this we always have to ask
ourselif couple of qusetions


1. What do I want to repeat?
> The text function with the message!


 
2. What do I want to change each time? 

>The y position increasing by 20 each time.
 


3. How long should we repeat?
  

> As long as y is less than 400, all the
  way down


after we answerd:
          3answer
while(till when u want to repeat this code)
          1answer
 {
  put here what do you want to repeat
          2answer
    var = var + 5

 
}
real example:

var y = 40;
while(y < 400)
 {
 
   text(message, 30, y);
 
   y += 20;
   
      }

so what if like we want to draw a guy 
holding some balloons:

first we ask our qustions
The Three Loop Questions:
 
1. What do I want to repeat? 
 the ballons
2. What do I want to change each time?60px 
 
3. How long should we repeat? till x<329

background(99, 200, 255);

stroke(116, 57, 204);

fill(221, 0, 255);

var x = 100;
while (x < 329)
 {
    line(x, 94, 224, 300);

    ellipse(x, 94, 49, 68);

    
    x += 60;
}

after we did lets grab an image to a gay:

image(getImage("url"), 100, 100, 40, 80);

for loops:

it the same almost
 
 for (variable; how long; change)
 for (var y = 63; y < 313; y += 41)
//note:
the semicolon in here is for spliting
each parameter of the other
 
 //n just complete like how u do
{
text("Pineapple pizza is the best!", 69, y);
}

but!      
                  (changing y)(changing x)
 what if you want to a coulm and a row:
here you can put a loop in a loop

æ
for (var y = 0; y < 13; y++)
 {
    for (var x = 0; y < 12; y++) {
 "url"), y*36
, y*30, 40, 60);
 }

}

to make it look like stairs:


for (var y = 0; y < 13; y++) 
{
image(getImage("cute/GemOrange"),
 y*36, y*30, 40, 60);
 
}




using loops with arrys:

so here is my friends

var myFriends = ["mohaned", "majed", "me",
 "bonn bonn", "mazen"];
text(myFriends[0], 10, 30);

text(myFriends[1], 10, 78);

text(myFriends[2], 10, 130);

text(myFriends[3], 10, 182);

n here is our questions
1. What do I want to repeat?
 

  the text() command
 

2. What do I want to change each time?

  the friend num, and the y position
 

3. How long should we repeat?
 

  until there are no more friends left

//to make everything adebends on it


var friendNum = 0;
          //3answer 
//that mean as long as friendnum variable
is less than my friends run this..

comment replay:
.length` is a property of JS arrays.
 You use it in statements like
 _arrayName_`

.length` This will return the
 number of elements in the given array.
 In the code at the end of the video,
 on line 11,

 Pamela has the code `myFriends.

length` This evaluates to 6 because there
 are six elements in the `myFriends` array.

 You can test this by pausing the video and
 typing `println(myFriends.length);` at the
 end of the code.

*/

while(friendNum < myFriends.length)

//now we add the caliing so they can show up
{
text(myFriends[friendNum], 10, friendNum);


//so he add one each time and call them all
n stop runing it when he rich 4 

friendNum++;
}

if not understood
https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming/arrays/pt/looping-through-arrays
but hey she wont explain the length thing
so foucas on my explaning
