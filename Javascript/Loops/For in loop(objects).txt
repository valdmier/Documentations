sooo...we v=both know how to use loop with arrays n show alll of its items ?right? butt how could we show the whole object items??

example:

var myCar = {
    color: "gray",
    model: "2022",
    price: "50k USD",
    type: "sydan"
};


for (let element in myCar) {

    console.log(`${element} : ${myCar[element]}`);
}


output:
-
 color : gray
 model : 2022
 price : 50k USD
  type : sydan
