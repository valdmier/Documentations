random:

you need to foucas up with me now


so if you puted 

var x = Math.random();

that will give you number between 0-1

maybe 

0  or 0.84858 or 0.759500875

but not 1

idk


but to tell him hey i want a random number between
that number n that number 

how to tell him that?:

//first put the reandom syntax


Math.random()



//second we will get number from 0-1 right?we wil 

multiply that number he give us to the number we want

to be the limit :


Math.random() * 10



//cool cool now it will be from 0-10...butt what if we got 0?multuplying 0 will give us 0 right?

to avoild that lets plus 1:

Math.random() * 10 + 1



// but!! what if i dont want to have like 3.499
like i just 4 5 9..not 7.8398493

shoud we use round?or ceil?or floor?


lets take 10.5 as an example:

Math.round(10.5) = 11..no we want from 1 - 10 not 11

Math.ceil(10.5) = 11..no we want from 1 - 10 not 11

Math.floor(10.5) = 10..yes thats it




so finally it will be:

Math.floor(Math.random() * 10 + 1)


//cool 
 

example: from 1-10


var x = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10 + 1);

console.log(x);

example: from 1-100


window.console.log( Math.floor(Math.random() * 100 + 1));
