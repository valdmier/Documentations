I've seen a lot of code where random numbers are generated like

// random integers in the interval [1, 10]

Math.floor(Math.random()*10 + 1)

Anyway, I feel like I'm missing something. Why don't people use the more succint way

Math.ceil(Math.random()*10);

?

answer:

 number in the range [0, 1) that is, from 0 (inclusive) up to but not including 1 (exclusive), which you can then scale to your desired range.


random integers in the interval [1, 10]:

Math.floor(Math.random()*10 + 1)


random integers in the interval [0, 9.99]:

Math.ceil(Math.random()*10);
