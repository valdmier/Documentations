object type:propites:

objects is way to call info and call it 
whenever u need it..the difrent between it
n arrays is that arrays you call them by 
numbers so you have to know witch number
is for that info n that doesnt help if you
have so many info..object by words n that is
much easy to remember

note: 
to start an object:{}
to make more details bout an element in the 
object:[]

var winston = {
  age: 19,

  eyes: "black",}  

likes: ["programming","being programmed"],

  
isCool: true,

 
 birthplace: {

city: "Mountain View",


   state: "California"
    
    }
  
n then put a the name of the var and (.)
a point and if i had two info or 3 4etc..
ad brackets:

fill(0, 0, 0);
textSize(16);


text("All about Winston:", 10, 30);


text("Winston is " + winston.age + " years
 old", 10, 50);


text("Winston has " + winston.eyes + 
" eyes", 10, 70);

.d                   //cuz we have two info 
  text("Winston likes " + winston.likes[0]
 +" and " +  winston.likes[1], 10, 90);

to call an object inside object:

text("Winston was born in " +
 winston.birthplace.city + ", " +
 winston.birthplace.state, 10, 110);


repeating an object with loops:

so we want our program to repeat his age
till the age of 40

first we bring our objects:

var winston = {
  age: 19,

  eyes: "black",

  

likes: ["programming","being programmed"],

  
isCool: true,

 
 birthplace: {

city: "Mountain View",


   state: "California"
    
    }

then bring our while loop:

while(winston.age <= 40) 
//so if its stops at 40
                      //so the age changes
{
text("Winston is " + winston.age + 
            
" years old", 10, winston.age*20 - 350);

 //and the y for each
             age change also by ading one
               each time */
    winston.age++;
}
//that change the y and age



how to draw winston as much as u want by 
object n loop or array :

var drawWinston = function(faceX, faceY){
fill(255, 255, 0);

ellipse(faceX, faceY, 300, 300);
 // face


fill(46, 46, 41);
ellipse(faceX - 45, faceY - 57, 40, 40);
 // eyes


ellipse(faceX + 102, faceY - 66, 40, 40);


fill(252, 65, 65);

ellipse(faceX + 55, faceY + 32, 120, 136); // mouth
    

fill(46, 46, 41);

ellipse(faceX - 45, faceY - 57, 40, 40);
 // eyes
    

ellipse(faceX + 102, faceY - 66, 40, 40);
    

fill(252, 65, 65);

ellipse(faceX + 55, faceY + 32, 120, 136);
 // mouth
}

//repeating the drawing by ararrys n loop:

var xPositions = [99, 294, 101,  294, 10, 1,
10]

;
var yPositions = [117, 117, 316, 316, 1, 1,
 1];


for (var i = 0; i < xPositions.length; i++){


drawWinston(xPositions[i], yPositions[i]);


}

and if you add a new number to the y n x 
array positions it will show up a new 
winston

but an array here is a little messy n 
confusing

//repeating the drawing by objects n loops:

var positions = [
  
{x: 99, y: 117},

{x: 294, y: 117},

{x: 101, y: 316},

{x: 294, y: 316}
  
];
for (var i = 0; i < positions.length; i++){


drawWinston(positions[i].x,
 positions[i].y);


}

n its more readable


object type:methood:

how to make characters then just change
on there propites:
  Çæá ÍÑÝ Ý ÇáÇæÈßÊ áÇÒã íßæä ßÈÊá we will change those parameters
var Winston = function(nickname, age, x, y)
{

this.nickname = nickname;


 this.age = age + "yrs old";


    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;

  };

what does this mean?:

it means u have a couple of propties n when
u write this that mean you're  mentioning
this properties n calling it to change 
them.


n now we have our character

the real method:

var Winston = function(nickname, age, x, y)
{

this.nickname = nickname;

this.age = age + "yrs old";


this.x = x;


this.y = y;

};

// the draw method


//prototybe:The JavaScript prototype
 property allows you to add new properties
 to object constructors*/

Winston.prototype.draw = function() {
    
fill(255, 0, 0);

    
var img = getImage("creatures/Winston");

    
image(img, this.x, this.y);
    

var txt = this.nickname + ", " + this.age;
    

text(txt, this.x+20, this.y-10);

    
};


};
winstonTeen.draw();
winstonTeen.talk();

winstonAdult.draw();
