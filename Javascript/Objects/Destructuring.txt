Destructuring :

The destructuring assignment syntax is a JavaScript 
expression that makes it possible to store values from 
arrays, or properties from objects, into
variables.

===
example with arrays:

var race = ["sami","Amanda","sara", "Naser", "ali"];

const [first, second, theird] = race;

console.log("1: " +first + " 2: " + second + " 3: " + theird); 

//RESULT: 1: sami 2: Amanda 3: sara

===
Object destructuring:

const user = {
    id: 42,
    is_verified: true
};

const {id, is_verified} = user;

===
We can exact properties from a object without accessing the
 complete object. For example,

Consider an object:

    let person= {
             firstName: 'Vanna',
             lastName: 'Vang',
             email: 'pede.et@euismodurnaNullam.ca',
             mobileNumber: '1-289-966-7754',
             companyName: 'Proin Mi Aliquam Company',
             orgNumber: '03816598299',
             gender: 'female',
             id: "ced851f2-95f7-4619-8ba7-83fcc5684aff",
          }

Now if I want to extract only firstName and lastName from
 the person object,

I can do it as below: let { firstName , lastName } = person;

The above line assigns the left side variables with values
 of that same properties in the right side object.
