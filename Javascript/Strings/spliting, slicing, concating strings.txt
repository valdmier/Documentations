split:

its the obesete of join().

split is a way to put something instead of something 
 
n it convert it from string to array

like to tell him hey put a space instead every 10:

var myString = "iam 10 in 10 love 10 with 10 javascript",

    String = myString.split("10");

console.log(String);



n the result will be:

["iam ", " in ", " love ", " with ", " javascript"]

slice syntax:

varname.slice(start, end)


example:


var myString = "iam in love with javascript",
  
           
    slicedString = myString.slice(16, 27);  

//started from letter num 16 n ended in 27

                  console.log(slicedString);


the result:


javascript


like that we sliced it


===


subStr :

it means subtracet witch is like minus

its syntax:

varName.subStr(start, length)

lenth here means how many letters after the number

u selected he will continue..

like if choosed 7 as the start n 10 as the length

he will select all the letter from 7 to 17



example:

var myString = "iam in love with javascript",
  
           
    slicedString = myString.substr(16, 11);  



                  console.log(slicedString);


the result:

javascript


so everything exept who is in 16 and 11 indexs after it exet those every thing will be deleted
