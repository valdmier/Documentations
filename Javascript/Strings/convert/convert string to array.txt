split():

it the obesete of join().

split is a way to put something instead of something 
 
n it convert it from string to array

like to tell him hey put a space instead every 10:

var myString = "iam 10 in 11 love 11 with 11 javascript",

    String = myString.split("11");

console.log(String);



n the result will be:

["iam ", " in ", " love ", " with ", " javascript"]


--

another example:

var myString = "my name is mohamed. n im 16. i live in saudi arabia.";


console.log(myString.split("."));

result:

"my name is mohamed", " n im 16", " i live in saudi arabia", ""]




and another:



console.log(wordLooking4);
