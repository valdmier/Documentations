the differences between:
 single quotations marks (' ')
and double quotations marks (" ")  :

they are the same but if u wanted to use one inside 
another u cant use them like that

var name = "mohammed "yemeni" " no thas wrong

u can use it like 
 
var name = "mohammed 'yemeni' " now thas right

or u can escape that is by adding a slash

var name = "mohammed /"yemeni/" " 


the slash tells the browswer hey dont take that as 
programing shit just dont mind it >>leave it alone
