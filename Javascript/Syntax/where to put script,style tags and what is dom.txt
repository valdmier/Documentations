the style tag you have to put it above
of the body tag not in it not under it
cuz:

Our browsers today process pretty fast,
 
so you often don't see the "FOUC" - flash

 of unstyled content. But if the browser

 was processing the page slower, and you
 
had the style at the bottom, then you might
 
see the unstyled HTML for some amount of
 
time first like some websites.

you have to put you're javascript before 
the ending of the body tag cuz:

the browser has some HTML to show before it
 has to go through the effort of parsing JS

 like: 
<style></style>
<body>
bla bla bla


<script></script>
</body>

dom means :

document object model

doucument= your webpage its code everything

object=like every single code in your
 webpage

model= ÿ—«“ «Ê ‰Ê⁄ Â–« «·ﬂ«∆‰

practicably:
webpage ||object ||the specif object   
document.body.innerHTML = "Webpage be gone!";
