its the same how alert works 

Display a prompt box which ask the user for her/his
 age, and output a message:
===

The prompt() method displays a dialog box that 
prompts the visitor for input. A prompt box is
 often used if you want the user to input a value
 before entering a page. Note: When a prompt box
 pops up, the user will have to click either "OK"
 or "Cancel" to proceed after entering an input
 value. Do not overuse this method, as it prevents
 the user from accessing other parts of the page
 until
 the box is closed. The prompt() method returns the
 input value if the user clicks "OK". If the user
 clicks "cancel" the method returns null.

example:





 <button onclick="myFunction()">Try it</button>

 <p id="demo"></p> 



<script> function myFunction() { var person =
 prompt("Please enter your age", "age"); 
        //the thing              //word in the box^



if (person < 18) {
 document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =

 "so yr age " + person + "! yr a teen or a kid?"; }

 } </script>
