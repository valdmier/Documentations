rule: the last thing you write will be
  above evrything and the opposite

  ellipse()every thing will be on this
  ellippe()
  ellipse()this will be in the top

ellipse:

ellipse(200,200,200,200);
 
what does those numbers mean?:
        ÇáØæá    ÇáÚÑÖ  ÇáãæŞÚ ÈÇáØæá  ÇáãæŞÚ ÈÇáÚÑÖ     
ellipse(  x  ,     y  ,   w,   h  );

the limit of numbers is 400

rectangle:

rect(100,100,100,100)

note:the ellipse are controled from the
center..but the rectangle is controled
from the upper lift corner so if you give 
them the same parameters they won't be 
in the same place

parameter=ÇáãÚÇãá

line:

line(x1,y1,x2,y2)

in the line there's 2 points..point to start
and point to end the x1 and h1 controls the 
left point position..h2 and x2 controls 
the right point


Òí ÇáÇíä ÇáãäÍÑİ ßá ÇËäíä íãËáæä ãæŞÚ äŞØå
quad(x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4);
every point of the quad have width and height


position width and height                                             ãäÍäì
arc(x, y, w, h,angle start,angle stop);
            to decide from where to where it will opened          

bezier(x1, y1, cx1, cy1, cx2, cy2, x2, y2)
serch for it

triangle(x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3)
serch for it

point(x, y)


if you Mess up between them..u didnt know
that rectangle 4 what and that line 4 what?
you can add comments:

rect(76, 45, 250, 300); // face

but what if you ended up making the whole
page a comment ?how to end a comment?:

//comment here
