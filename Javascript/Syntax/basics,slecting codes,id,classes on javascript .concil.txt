basics 
if something went wrong 
note:in every code make sure to the capital capital
n the small small n make sure to put 
semicolon

mentioning:

to select the whole body innerhtml:

document.body.innerHTML="hacked by lucifer";

--


and in the innerHTML you can add some html
tags like:

documen.body.innerHTML="<strong>hacked</strong> by lucifer"



but the innerHTML property 
cleaer the the old things you added to the orginal 
html 


==

 if you wanted something that just put a new 
text:


headingEl.textContent = "hacked by lucifer";



note: you cant add tags like <strong> to it


===


to mention an id called heading:
//1-


var headingEL = document.getElementById
("headingEL"); 


or


var headingEL = docment.querySelector
("#headingEL");


//2-


headingEl.innerHTML = "write here what ever 
you want instead what was wrotten";

//Why did we store the id in variablein the
1st step n named it with EL in the end?:

because we cant change the id directly
later so we have to use variable to mention
it lin the next step and EL means its an 
element in the heeding or in the body..etc


to select classes:

we use here "getElementsByClassName"
or
"querySelector"

1

var bla = document.getElementsByClass
Name("nameEls")

or

var bla  = docment.querySelector
(".nameEls");

2
var i = 0

  while(i < bla.length)
 {
       bla[i].innerHTML = "cat";
               
        i++
   } 
//like that we will change every thing in
the class to "cat"

//why i wrote bla[i]?:

cuz there like 5 codes in the class
 so he will run
 bla[0],bla[1],bla[2],bla[3]
bla[4]...n stops cuz the the 
bla.length is 5 n he cant eqaul it



//Why did we store the id in variable in the
1st step?:

because we cant change the id directly
later so we have to use variable to mention
it lin the next step and EL means its an 
element in the heeding or in the body..etc



to select codes(h1,p...etc):

we use something called:
"getElementsByTagName"
or
"querySelector"

so lets suposse we want to select all the 
"span" tags in the page:
1

var nameEls = document.getElementsByTagName
("span");

or 

var nameE1s = docment.querySelector("span");

2 if u want to call them one by one: 

  nameEls[0].innerHTML = "cat";
  nameEls[1].innerHTML = "cat";
  nameEls[2].innerHTML = "cat";
  nameEls[3].innerHTML = "cat";
  nameEls[4].innerHTML = "cat";
//etc...as much as you have..here we have 5

n cant use the same way like before in
the id cuz id length before was one part
..in this webpage there are so many spans
 so we will use another way using loop :

var i = 0

  while(i < nameEls.length)
 {
       nameEls[i].innerHTML = "cat";
               
        i++
   } 
//like that we will change every thing in
the span to "cat"

//why i wrote nameEls[i]?:

cuz there like 5 spans so he will run
 nameEls[0],nameEls[1],nameEls[2],nameEls[3]
nameEls[4]...n stops cuz the the 
nameEls.length is 5 n he cant eqaul it



//Why did we store the id in variable in the
1st step?:

because we cant change the id directly
later so we have to use variable to mention
it lin the next step and EL means its an 
element in the heeding or in the body..etc




console: is something in the browsers that
shows you if something is working or not 

you can make it show up by pressing  F12

then wait a while then press the console 
word

imprtant:to make sure that something is 
working using console:

1 make a variable of that you want to 
test out
         the variable name you made
2  console.log(nameEls);

and put in variable the thing you want 
to test


advanced selecting:

to continue u have to know css selectors!!

<p class="animal"> dog </p>
 
how to select this css selectors in java:

 p .animal {color: red;
}

by the querySelectorAll
1
var nameEls = document.querySelector
All("p .animal");

2
2 if u want to call them one by one: 

  nameEls[0].innerHTML = "cat";
  nameEls[1].innerHTML = "cat";
  nameEls[2].innerHTML = "cat";
  nameEls[3].innerHTML = "cat";
  nameEls[4].innerHTML = "cat";
//etc...as much as you have..here we have 5


 or using loop(better) :

var i = 0

  while(i < nameEls.length)
 {
       nameEls[i].innerHTML = "cat";
               
        i++
   } 

      

you also can replace "getElementsByClass
Name"and "getElementsByid" 

by  "querySelectorAll" :

for class:
1
<h1 class="heading">All about dogs</h1>
2
var headingEl = document.querySelector
(".heading");
 

headingEl.innerHTML = "All about cats";


for id:
1
<h1 id="heading">All about dogs</h1>
2
var headingEl = document.querySelectorA
ll("#heading");
 

headingEl.innerHTML = "All about cats";

n u can try other stuff

The difference between
 querySelector():
يشتغل فيه عامل واحد بس للتحديد مثلا كلاس من نوع واحد
 او اي دي من نوع واحد فقط ولازم تحط #لو اي دي ونقطه لو كلاس
 and
 querySelectorAll() : تقدر تسلكت فيه عده عوامل للتحديد 
   مثلا كل اللي برغراف و كلاس معين
 وهكذا ومو لازم تحط العلامه حق الايدي اوالكلاس
يشتغل
