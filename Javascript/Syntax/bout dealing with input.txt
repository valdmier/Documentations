well to get whats inside the input u say :

<input type="text" id="example">



document.getElementById("dollar").value


//so we use value to get whats inside not innerHTML




===


and if want to put an IF statment we act with 
everything inside it as a string but the truth its not

example:

 var amount = document.getElementById("dollar").value


if (amount === "0") { bla bla  }

//not if (amount === 0)..cuz its a text input
 everything inside it is text but it could deal with
it as number  though
