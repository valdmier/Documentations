when to use return:


function drawwinston() {
    "use strict";
    
    var name = "lucifer",
        age = 16;
}

document.getElementById("example").innerHTML =
 drawwinston();




.. the result will be undefined..why is that?:

cuz the function dont know what to show

just gave it some variable and its values 

so what will should i show he asks?

to tell him what to show we use return 


example:



function drawwinston() {
    "use strict";
    
    var name = "lucifer",
        age = 16;
   
    return name + " " + age;
}

document.getElementById("example").innerHTML =
 drawwinston();



and he will show the age and name cuz you said hey
 when i call u return the age and name value
