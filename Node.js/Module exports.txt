its all about sharing JavaScript code between different 
files.


in the world of the browser client side JavaScript, if we
 have different JavaScript files, we just include them in
 the same HTML document.


---
With node we have a completely different system.

where we can be very particular about what a single file shares
and what it does not share.

===
example:

first make a file n lets name it math:

const add = (x, y) => x + y;

const square = x => x * x;


module.exports.square = square;
module.exports.add = add;


--
to export it to another file :

const math = require("./math"); //put here the directory

console.log(math.square(9)); 
console.log(math.add(9, 1));

the result:
