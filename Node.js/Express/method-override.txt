forms onlu accepts post and get reqests so to fix that
you need to trick the form

to do that we need method-override
===
Install:
$ npm install method-override
---

example:

var express = require('express')
var methodOverride = require('method-override')
var app = express()

app.use(methodOverride('_method'))

--
ejs/html document:

//here we are sending patch reqest you can change the type
 of reqest as you wish
//note the form metod gotta be always set to post


<form method="POST" 
action="/whatever/<%=something.id%>?_method=PATCH">

<!-- its not really a post reqest its a patch to 
see that check the href -->

==
so the part you should add is: ?_method=PATCH"
