Serving static files in Express

To serve static files such as images, CSS files, and JavaScript files, use the express.static built-in middleware function in Express.

For example, use the following code to serve images, CSS files, and JavaScript files in a directory named public:

app.use(express.static('public'))

Now, you can load the files that are in the public directory:

===
first make folder that contains css n js files
//make it next to the node modules n veiws files 

then call it:
app.use(express.static('public'));


then you can use the files inside of them freely


just add the link tag:

 <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/style.css">

//note: u dont have to add the file name
