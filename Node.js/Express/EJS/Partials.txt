its just parts of the code that u save n call it later so dont have to write the code over and over.

explaining:

1-make folder next the view folder n the modules folder(make inside of the main folder)

2-name it , i'll name it Partials

3- make ejs folder inside it , i'll name it head
 and put inside the code u wanna reuse 

4-go to the file u wanna reuse the code in n put that to call it:

<%- include('Partials/head') %>

n thats it
===
example:

Partials/head.ejs file:

<head>
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">
    <title>training</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/css/bootstrap.min.css">
    <script src="/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
</head>


calling it:

i deleted the head tag then put:

<%- include('Partials/head') %>


n just like that
