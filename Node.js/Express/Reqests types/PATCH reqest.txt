 The PATCH method requests that a set of changes described 
in the request entity be applied to the resource identified 
by the Request- URI. The set of changes is represented in 
a format called a "patch document" identified by a media 
type. If the Request-URI does not point to an existing
 resource, the server MAY create a new resource, depending
 on the patch document type (whether it can logically
 modify a null resource) and permissions, etc.
