The POST method is used to request that the origin server
 accept the entity enclosed in the request as a new
 subordinate of the resource identified by the
 Request-URI in the Request-Line

In other words, POST is used to create.

post expects two things:

1- It expects the path that we are matching.

2-function to respond with

===

let express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.post('/cats', function (req, res) {
    res.send('meow from post req')
});
app.get('/cats', function (req, res) {
    res.send('meow from get req')
});

app.listen(8080, () => {
    console.log('RUNNING ON PORT 8080!');
});
