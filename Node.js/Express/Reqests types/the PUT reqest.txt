  The PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored
 under the supplied Request-URI. If the Request-URI refers
 to an already existing resource, the enclosed entity 
SHOULD be considered as a modified version of the one
 residing on the origin server. If the Request-URI does
 not point to an existing resource, and that URI is 
capable of being defined as a new resource by the
 requesting user agent, the origin server can create
 the resource with that URI."
