its a file that if u dont have it n u tried to install
somthing from npm then its gonna give u a warning that u dont

that file helps anyone who sees your code to 
understand the dependencies of your code n the license 
the author.

how to make it:
//type in he terminal:

npm init 

//somthing wil pop up

//name the package
package name: (artster)

//number the version
version: (1.0.0)

//put a descriotion if u want
description:

//the entry pointgonna index.js by default 
entry point: (index.js)

//the others doesnt really matter just hit enter
test command:
git repository:
keywords:
author: Lucifer
