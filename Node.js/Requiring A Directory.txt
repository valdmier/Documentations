lets get started real quick:


fisrt lets make a folder n name house 

house contains me n salem n abdo

me contents:
module.exports = {
    name: "mohammed",
    height: "tall"
}

abdo contents:

module.exports = {
    name: "abdo",
    height: "tall"
}

salem contents:

module.exports = {
    name: "salem",
    height: "chuppy"
}
==
then we make another file to lonl all the files to it:
its prefered to name it index so the computer open it first 
we open the folder..if we didnt name it index then when we 

call the folder we'll have to tell him wthat specific
 file he should open inside that folder but if we named

 it index then when just telling him open that folder 
he'll automaticly open the index file


index file contents:

const me = require("./me");
const abdo = require("./abdo");
const salem = require("./salem");

const allhouse = [me, salem, abdo];

console.log(allhouse);

module.exports = allhouse;


===
now lets go to a file thats inside the same folder that
house is in but not inside house

back.js:

const math = require("./house");

or if u didnt name it index 

const math = require("./house/whtaeverYouNamedIT");
