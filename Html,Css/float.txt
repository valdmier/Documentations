floating:
æÇááí ãÚäÇåÇ ÇáØİæ

simply that means something around or
in something elase

so if there'S an image and text under
it..and you want the image to be
sorrounded by the text :

img{folat:right;}

æİí ÎÇÕíå ÊŞÏÑ ÊÓÊÚãá ÈÏáåÇ ÇáÈæÒÔä æåÓ Çá ßáíÑ
clear:
it's like there's three elements
and you made 2 two floating..n the 
third one Crossed one of them..
so you make clear to grap the third
element down to stop the crossing

imoprtant note:if something you want it
to float but it's not working..that's
because of might be big and doesnt fit
resize it!
