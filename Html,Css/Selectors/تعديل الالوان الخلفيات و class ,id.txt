     to change the color:
           
            h1{color:green:}  or
            h1{color:rgb(number,number,number);}
    
  to change the background color

   body {background-color:rgb(num,num,num):}

   body {background-color:blue;}
        
   important note:you can't make spaces in the names of ides and clases
            
   css selectors 

           id: „À«·
          
  <h1id="ooo9">
   to tag it: <style>
              
   #ooo9{background-color:rgb(n,n,n);}

    </style>
      
   note:don't put 2 of it

    another way to put styles:
   
   inline style:
<h1 style="background: salmon;">Salmon
   </h1>
    
            

   selecting:

    specificity:
   if the orders were Contradictor
 "the browser always take the most 
  specif order..if they were in the
  same level of specificity..the
 browser takes the newest one

example:
p{color:red;}
p{color:blue;}
like that the browser will make it blue
     

   class:to to make a groubs and chnge them togther
   <h1 class="bla">

    we can tag it:
  .bla{bla bla bl}
 
  what does the space in the clases
  means: 

   it means that the tag belongs to 
   two classes 

    for example:
   <h2 class="1 2">
   that mean it belongs to class
   1 and 2..
   
   what oreders will it follow?:
   it wil follow both but if the codes
  were contradictory and aginst each
  other orders like one its color is
  red and the other is white  
   
  in that case it will folow the second
  one..which is here class "2"
  

   what if we have a class that 
contains all images and the text
 and i just want to select the images
only and add border to them
 and the class name was "mo":

img.mo{border:10px dashed red;}

note: dont put space between the img
and the class name"img .om"dont do like
this..it means another thing we wiil will
explin it down


to select two elements:

h1,h2 {color:red;}



to select every class inside a code

p .classname{color:red;}

so like that we will look inside every p
n select the staff that have 
"class name" class
