to change any thing width and height:

img{width: 70%;
 height: 180px;}

overflow:
sometimes you want to ad something real
important but you don't have enough 
space for it so you try to resize it
but it doesnt work and come out of the
limits you want it to be in

solution is:
1- put the text or the picture 
 or both of them by div in the size 
you want them to be in 
2- div{overflow:auto;}

and like that you will add scroll bars
and the user can scroll down 

margin:


if i want for example my picture
to be away from the text 10px far
and the text was under it:

img{margin-bottom: 10px;}

or in the right

img{margin-right;10px;}
or in the left
img{margin-left:10px;}

«–« «»€Ï «Õÿ ÕœÊœ ··’Ê—Â «Ê ··‰’ : 
img {border: 2px solid purple}
instead of solid we have other styles
like:ridge or groove,double,dotted
dashed.

the colors you can use rgb instead of
the name of the color

border:

if i want the border to be in the right 
img {border-top: 10px solid purple;}

u can use also border-left
 border-bottom as well

padding:

padding is the space between the border
and the content

so if i want some space between
the border and the content:

div{padding:10px;}
