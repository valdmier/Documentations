first-child Pseudo-class:matches a specified 
element that is the first child of another element.
 
example:

p:first-child {
  color: blue;
} 
</style>

n like that he will use the first paragraph number 1

===

to select all the first <b> tags that are inside a 
paragraph :

<p>I am a <b>strong</b> person. I am a <b>strong</b> person.</p>
<p>I am a <b>strong</b> person. I am a <b>strong</b> person.</p>

<style>
p:first-child i {
  color: blue;
} 
</style>

that would make the first b in each paragraph blue

===

cuz store any propties in it and use it later 

example:
<style>
       name it
q:lang(lucifer) {
