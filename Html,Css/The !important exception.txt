!important :

When an important rule is used on a style declaration, this declaration will be made no matter how specefic other style declaration are.

Some rules of thumb:

Always look for a way to use specificity before even considering !important
Only use !important on page-specific CSS that overrides foreign CSS (from external libraries, like Bootstrap or normalize.css).
Never use !important when you're writing a plugin/mashup.
Never use !important on site-wide CSS.

example:

 p {

            background-color:beige !important;
          }
          p{
              background-color: cadetblue;
          }
