Popovers:

note:Popovers: could be used with almost any html item

Popovers is like a notifiction that appers when you click on it

but to make this thing really work..make sure that you put this in the script file:


$(function () {
  $('[data-toggle="popover"]').popover()
})

---

lets get started with an example:

<button class="btn btn-danger btn-lg" data-toggle="popover" title="THANKS" data-content="for puting the js code to be able to see me(::!!">Click on me</button>

the data-toggle: is to tell bootstrap that this is a Popover.

the tittle: is to tell bootstrap what should be written in the tittle of the popover.

data content: to tell bootstrap whats the content of the popover or the massege.

But!! like that it wont dispear till u click the button again


how to make it disapear:

1- use the <a> tag, not the <button> tag.
2-include a tabindex attribute.
3- include a data-trigger attribute and set it to focus.

example:

 <a class="btn btn-danger btn-lg" tabindex="0" data-trigger="focus" data-toggle="popover" title="THANKS" data-content="for puting the js code to be able to see me(::!!"> Click on me</a>
