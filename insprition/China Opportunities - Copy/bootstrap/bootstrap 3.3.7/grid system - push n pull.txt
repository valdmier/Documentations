well lets start explaning push:


push n pull is kinda like offset cuz they both push the element 

from its left side towards the right .. but the diffrent is 

that offset is like real margin like the space the margin 

takes like if there where a real element there..

 but push n pull and pull is just putting stuff some wehere

however lets make an example:

before push n pull:

  <div class="col-md-4">    <div class="os">1</div>   </div>

<div class="col-md-8">    <div class="os">2</div>   </div>



after pudh n pull:

<div class="container">
    <div class="row">
    
     
         <div class="col-md-4 col-md-push-8">    <div class="os">1</div>   </div>
         <div class="col-md-8 col-md-pull-4">    <div class="os">2</div>   </div>
       
 </div>

  </div>
