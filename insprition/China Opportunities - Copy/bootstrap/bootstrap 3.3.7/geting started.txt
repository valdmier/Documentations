first of alll go to the bootstrap folder u

 have downloaded

then take the bootstarp.js,bootstrap.css,bootstrap.jqery.

take them to your working file 

and link them in the index file like that:


  <link rel='stylesheet' href='style.css'>
            
           <!-- Bootstrap CSS -->
  <link rel='stylesheet' href='bootstrap.css'>




<!-- jQuery first, then main.js, then Bootstrap JS -->

<script src = "jquery.min.js"></script>   
    <script src = "script.js"></script>
    <script src = "bootstrap.min.js"></script>


now we have to add a meta for a responsive website:


 <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">


n lets add a meta to make it fit with internet explorer:


<meta http-equiv="X-UA Compatible" content="IE=edge">


n lets add the more libraries to make the website fit with inter net explorer 

 <!--[if lt IE 9]>   
<script src = "respond.min.js"></script>
<script src = "html5shiv.min.js"></script> 
<![endif]-->



the comment if it ie 9 ..etc means if u browse that on ie9 these libraries will work...but in other browsers it will stay as comment

html5shiv library: is for leting the IE know html5 elements

respond library: for fixing some responsivty proplems
