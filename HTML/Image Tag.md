# HTML Image (`<img>`) Tag Documentation

The HTML Image (`<img>`) tag is a fundamental element used to display images on web pages. Images are essential for enhancing visual content, making web pages more engaging, and conveying information effectively. The `<img>` tag allows web developers to embed images into their web documents, contributing to a richer user experience.

## Syntax

The basic syntax of the `<img>` tag is as follows:

```html
<img src="image-source" alt="alternate-text">
```

- **`src` (Source):** The `src` attribute specifies the source URL of the image. It can be an absolute URL (e.g., "https://www.example.com/image.jpg") or a relative URL (e.g., "images/pic.jpg"). The `src` attribute is required, as it determines the location of the image file.

- **`alt` (Alternate Text):** The `alt` attribute provides alternative text that is displayed when the image cannot be loaded or when the user hovers over it. This text is also crucial for accessibility, as it helps visually impaired users understand the image's content.

## Examples

Here are some examples of how to use the `<img>` tag:

1. Embedding an Image from an External Source:
   
   ```html
   <img src="https://www.example.com/images/logo.png" alt="Company Logo">
   ```

2. Displaying an Image from the Same Website (Relative URL):
   
   ```html
   <img src="images/pic.jpg" alt="Beautiful Scenery">
   ```

3. Adding Alternative Text:
   
   ```html
   <img src="icons/star.png" alt="Star Icon">
   ```

4. Image with Specific Dimensions (Width and Height):
   
   ```html
   <img src="product.jpg" alt="Product Photo" width="200" height="150">
   ```

5. Decorative Image with Empty `alt` Attribute:
   
   ```html
   <img src="decoration.jpg" alt="">
   ```

## Attributes

The `<img>` tag supports various attributes for customizing images and improving accessibility:

- **`width` and `height`:** These attributes specify the width and height of the image, respectively. They can be used to control the image's display dimensions. Be careful when resizing images to maintain their aspect ratio and prevent distortion.

- **`title`:** The `title` attribute provides a title or description of the image. When users hover over the image, this text is displayed as a tooltip. It complements the `alt` attribute and can offer additional context.

- **`loading`:** This attribute controls how the browser loads and displays the image. It can have values such as "lazy" (loads when it becomes visible in the viewport), "eager" (loads immediately), or "auto" (default browser behavior).

- **`decoding`:** The `decoding` attribute specifies how the browser decodes the image. It can have values like "async" (decode asynchronously), "sync" (decode synchronously), or "auto" (default browser behavior).

## Best Practices

When working with the `<img>` tag, it's essential to follow best practices to optimize image usage on web pages:

### 1. Use Descriptive `alt` Text

Always provide meaningful and concise alternative text using the `alt` attribute. This is essential for accessibility and search engine optimization (SEO). Avoid using generic text like "image" or leaving the `alt` attribute empty.

### 2. Optimize Images

Optimize images for web use to reduce file sizes and improve page loading speed. Tools like image compressors and optimizers can help strike a balance between quality and performance.

### 3. Specify Image Dimensions

Set the `width` and `height` attributes to define the image's display size. This prevents layout shifts as images load and enhances the user experience.

### 4. Use the `title` Attribute

The `title` attribute can provide additional information about the image. It's particularly useful when images contain details that might not be apparent from the image alone.

### 5. Accessibility

Ensure your images are accessible by providing accurate alternative text, adhering to semantic HTML, and testing your website with screen readers and accessibility tools.
