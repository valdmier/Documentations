# HTML Elements Documentation: `<hr>`, `<br>`, `<span>`, and `<div>`

HTML provides a range of elements to structure and format content. This documentation introduces four such elements: `<hr>`, `<br>`, `<span>`, and `<div>`, with their meanings and common usage.

## `<hr>` - Horizontal Rule

- **English Meaning**: "Horizontal Rule"

The `<hr>` element creates a thematic break or horizontal line, often used to separate content sections visually.

**Example:**

```html
<h2>Section 1</h2>
<p>This is the content of Section 1.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Section 2</h2>
<p>This is the content of Section 2.</p>
```

## `<br>` - Line Break

- **English Meaning**: "Line Break"

The `<br>` element inserts a line break within text or content, forcing text or elements that follow it to appear on the next line.

**Example:**

```html
<p>This text<br>will break onto a new line.</p>
```

## `<span>`

- **English Meaning**: "Span"

The `<span>` element is an inline container used to apply styles or scripts to specific portions of text within a larger text block.

**Example:**

```html
<p>This is <span style="color: blue;">blue text</span> within a paragraph.</p>
```

## `<div>`

- **English Meaning**: "Division"

The `<div>` element defines a block-level container, used to group and style multiple HTML elements as a unit. It's often employed for layout and CSS styling purposes.

**Example:**

```html
<div style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px;">
  <h2>Header</h2>
  <p>This is a styled division with header and content.</p>
</div>
```

These elements are essential for structuring, formatting, and styling content in HTML documents, improving their readability and user experience.
