## Introduction to HTML Forms

HTML forms are used to collect and process user input on web pages. They allow users to enter data, make selections, and submit information to web servers for further processing. Forms are composed of various elements and attributes that define their behavior.

### Basic Form Structure

A basic HTML form is defined using the `<form>` element. Inside the form, you can include various input fields, buttons, labels, and other elements. Here's a simple form structure:

```html
<form action="/submit" method="post">
  <!-- Form elements go here -->
</form>
```

### Form Attributes

- `action`: Specifies the URL where the form data is sent for processing (e.g., a server script).
- `method`: Defines the HTTP method used for sending form data, typically "get" or "post."
