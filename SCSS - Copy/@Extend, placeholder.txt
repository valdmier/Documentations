extend is way to add a class to another class


example:

<p class = "class1"> hi im 1</p>
<p class = "class2"> hi im 2</p>
<p class = "class3"> hi im 3</p>


.elementsSize {
    
    margin: 30px;
    border: 4px dashed red;
    margin: 30px;     
}

.class1 {
    @extend .elementsSize;
    color: red;
}


.class2 {
    @extend .elementsSize;
    color: blue;

}

.class3 {
    @extend .elementsSize;
    color: yellow;
}



Now here comes the interesting part. What if we never

 use the icon class in our markup and its only purpose 
is to be there to extend? The resulting CSS will be 
slightly larger than it really needs to be because 
we'll have a style that will never be used. We can get
around this with placeholder selectors.



Enter placeholder selectors:


Placeholder selectors were introduced to solve this

 exact problem. They are very similar to class 
selectors, but instead of using a period (.) at the 
start, the percent character (%) is used. Placeholder 
selectors have the additional property that they will 
not show up in the generated CSS, only the selectors that extend them will be included in the output.

example:


<p class = "class1"> hi im 1</p>
<p class = "class2"> hi im 2</p>
<p class = "class3"> hi im 3</p>


%elementsSize {
    
    margin: 30px;
    border: 4px dashed red;
    margin: 30px;     
}

.class1 {
    @extend %elementsSize;
    color: red;
}


.class2 {
    @extend %elementsSize;
    color: blue;

}

.class3 {
    @extend %elementsSize;
    color: yellow;
}
