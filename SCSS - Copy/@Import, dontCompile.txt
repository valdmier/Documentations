Sass extends CSS's @import rule with the ability to 

import Sass and CSS files to sass files, n stylesheets. providing access to 
mixins, functions, and variables and combining 
multiple stylesheets' CSS together. Unlike plain CSS 
imports, which require the browser to make multiple 
HTTP requests as it renders your page, Sass imports are handled entirely during compilation.

 اللي بيتكلم عليها فوق ذا بيأخر الصفحه لكن ب لغه الساس الوضع مختلف وما بيسوي كذا وعادي تقدر تستخدم ال أيم بورت 


ok with that being said ...



so our main style file is style.scss lets import another file to it


i named it _newFont.scss

i puted that in it:

body {
font-family:monospace;

}

n then i went to my main file (style.scss) n imprted it n thats how:

@import "_newFont.scss";

note: when improrting u dont have to add the _ or the ".scss" or ".css" ...just the name of the file

note:
/*why the " _ "? thats the way to tell the compiler 

hey dont compile that...why i dont want him to compile
it?
cuz when i import him to my main folder then he will

 comile him again...so i just want him to compile it once the folder is imported */
