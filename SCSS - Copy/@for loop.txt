for loop is a loop what can i say?'-'


sooo yeah lets get to the example but before that i want to tell u that when u want to replace a sytax in the language itself u have to put #{$i}


example:

th eexample idea is that we call the whole q0 clases with out having to repeat . and increase the font size each time.

<p id = "class1">ERO</p>    
<p id = "class2">ERO</p>    
<p id = "class3">ERO</p>    
<p id = "class4">ERO</p>    
<p id = "class5">ERO</p>    
<p id = "class6">ERO</p>    
<p id = "class7">ERO</p>    
<p id = "class8">ERO</p>    
<p id = "class9">ERO</p>    
<p id = "class10">ERO</p>    

@for $i from 1 through 10 {
    #class#{$i} {
        font-size: 11px + $i;
  
    
    } 
    
    
    
}
