Functions are defined using the @function at-rule, 

which is written @function <name>(<arguments...>) {

 ... }. A functionâ€™s name can be any Sass identifier.

 It can only contain universal statements, as well as 

the @return at-rule which indicates the value to use 

as the result of the function call. Functions are 

called using the normal CSS function syntax.

@function NAMED($para){

 
    

simple example: 

    @return $para + 10;
}

.class1{
    
    font-size: NAMED(80px);
    
    
    
}
