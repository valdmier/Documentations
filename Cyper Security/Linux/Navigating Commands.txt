Navigating the Linux File System:

===
Root Directory

Root Directory: Highest-level directory in Linux, represented as a forward slash (/).

All subdirectories branch from the root.

Subdirectories can branch further as needed.

===
Standard FHS Directories

Standard directories found directly below the root:

/home: Each user has their own home directory.

/bin: Contains binary files and executables.

/etc: Stores system configuration files.

/tmp: Holds temporary files (commonly used by attackers because anyone in the system can modify data in these files.).

/mnt: Stores media like USB drives and hard drives.

===
User-Specific Subdirectories:

Under /home, subdirectories for specific users (e.g., analyst, analyst2).

Users have personal subdirectories (e.g., projects, logs, reports).

User's home directory can be represented as ~ (tilde) when referencing subdirectories within it.

===
