Linux architecture:

===
 Components that together make up Linux:

- User: The person interacting with a computer.

- Applications: A program that performs a specific task. 

- Shell: The command-line interpreter.

- Filesystem hierarchy standard (FHS): The component that organizes data.
   
- Kernel: The componet tof the linux OS that manages proccesses and memory.

- Hardware: The phsical components of the computer.

Linux Architecture Explained

- Components in Linux architecture include:
  
  1. User:
  - Interacts with the computer.
  - Initiates and manages tasks.
  - Linux is multi-user, allowing simultaneous resource use.

  2. Applications:
  - Programs performing specific tasks (e.g., word processors).
  - Distributed via package managers.
  - Example: Nano (text editor).

  3. Shell:
  - Command-line interpreter.
  - Processes commands and provides results.
  - Similar to Command Line Interface (CLI).

  4. Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS):
  - Organizes data in Linux OS.
  - Analogous to a filing cabinet for data storage.
  - Ensures data organization and accessibility.

  5. Kernel:
  - Manages processes and memory.
  - Communicates with hardware to execute shell commands.
  - Utilizes drivers for application task execution.
  - Enhances resource allocation and system speed.

---
  6. Hardware:
 Physical computer components.

---
 - Peripheral Devices:

Attached and controlled by the computer.
Not core components for basic operation.
Easily added or removed.
Examples: Monitors, Printers, Keyboard, Mouse.

---
- Internal Hardware:
Essential components to run the computer.

Includes the main circuit board (Motherboard).
Components:
- Central Processing Unit (CPU).
- Random Access Memory (RAM).
- Hard Drive

===
- Summary:
  - User initiates tasks in Linux.
  - Applications perform specific functions.
  - Shell interprets commands.
  - FHS organizes data.
  - Kernel manages processes and memory.
  - Hardware comprises physical components, internal and perioheral.
