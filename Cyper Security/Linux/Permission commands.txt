 Linux File and Directory Permissions:

===
Permissions and Authorization

Permissions: Control the type of access granted for a file or directory.

Authorization: Grant access to specific resources, limiting access on a need-to-know basis.


===
Three Types of Permissions

- Read: Allows reading file contents or listing directory files.

- Write: Permits modifying file contents or creating files in a directory.

- Execute: Enables running executable files or accessing files within a directory.


===
Three Types of Owners

- User: The owner of the file or directory.

- Group: A set of users with shared access.

- Other: All other users on the system.


===
Representing Permissions

Permissions are represented by a 10-character string in Linux.

" drwxrwxrwx "
(Full permissions for the user, group, and other in a directory).

===
Breaking Down the Permission String

- 1st Character: File type (e.g., d for directory, - for a regular file).

- 2nd to 4th Characters: User permissions (read, write, execute).

- 5th to 7th Characters: Group permissions (read, write, execute).

- 8th to 10th Characters: Other permissions (read, write, execute). characters signify other permissions.

===
Checking Permissions with ls\

ls command options:]

ls -a: Displays hidden files (those starting with .).

ls -l: Shows permissions for files and directories, along with additional details.

ls -la: Displays permissions for all files, including hidden ones.


===
Changing Permissions with chmod

chmod command changes permissions on files and directories.

Requires two arguments:

- First argument specifies permission changes.

- Second argument indicates the file or directory to change.

Example:
 chmod u+rwx,g+rwx,o+rwx login_sessions.txt

===
Adds all permissions for user, group, and other.

Example: 

chmod u-rwx,g-rwx,o-rwx login_sessions.txt

Removes all permissions for user, group, and other.

Example: chmod u=r,g=r,o=r login_sessions.txt

Sets read permissions for user, group, and other.


===
Permission Change Options
+: Adds permissions.
-: Removes permissions.
=: Assigns permissions exactly as specified.
u: User permissions.
g: Group permissions.
o: Other permissions.


===
Principle of Least Privilege

Principle of least privilege: Grant minimal access required for a task.

Ensures users only have necessary privileges to perform their jobs.

Example: Changing permissions to align with the principle of least privilege.
