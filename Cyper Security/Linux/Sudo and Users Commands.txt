Sudo and Users Commands

===
Root User and sudo:

- Root user or superuser has elevated privileges.

- It's not recommended to run commands as the root user due to security risks, irreversible mistakes, and lack of command tracking.

- Instead, use sudo to temporarily grant elevated permissions to specific users.

===
sudo Explained:

sudo stands for "super user do."

Users must be given access in the "sudoers file" to use sudo.

Using sudo is safer than logging in as the root user.

===
Responsible sudo Usage:

Even if you have sudo access, use it only for necessary commands.

Running commands with sudo bypasses regular security controls.

Be cautious when copying commands from online sources to avoid accidental sudo usage.

===
Commands:

===
useradd:

Adds a user to the system.

Example: sudo useradd fgarcia

Options:

-g: Sets the user's default (primary) group.

-G: Adds the user to additional (supplemental or secondary) groups.

==
- Example with -g: sudo useradd -g security fgarcia

- Example with -G: sudo useradd -G finance,admin fgarcia

===
usermod:

Modifies existing user accounts.

Can use -g and -G options similar to useradd to change primary and supplemental groups.

Example to add a supplemental group: sudo usermod -a -G marketing fgarcia.

===
userdel:

Deletes a user from the system.

Example: sudo userdel fgarcia.

Use -r to delete the user's home directory: sudo userdel -r fgarcia.

===
chown:

Changes ownership of a file or directory.

Example to change user owner: sudo chown fgarcia access.txt.

Example to change group owner:

 sudo chown :security access.txt (use a colon before the group name).

Additional options available with chown for more advanced ownership changes.
