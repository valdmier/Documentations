## **Parameters vs. Arguments in Python Functions**

In Python, it's important to understand the distinction between parameters and arguments when working with functions:

---

### **Parameters:**

- Parameters are variables defined in the function's signature.
- They act as placeholders for the values that the function expects to receive when it's called.
- Parameters are like function-local variables and help the function operate on specific data.
- Parameters are defined in the function definition and serve as the function's interface.

---

### **Arguments:**

- Arguments are the actual values or expressions passed to a function when it's called.
- They correspond to the parameters defined in the function's signature.
- Arguments provide the data with which the function performs its operations.
- Functions use arguments to work with real data, and they are specified when the function is called.

**Example:**

```python
def greet(name):  # 'name' is a parameter
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("Alice")  # 'Alice' is an argument
```

In this example:

- `name` is a parameter defined in the function.
- When we call `greet("Alice")`, "Alice" is the argument provided to the `name` parameter.

Understanding the difference between parameters and arguments is crucial for effective function usage and proper data handling in Python.
