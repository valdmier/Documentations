## **Python `list.append()` Method Documentation**

### **Overview**

The `list.append()` method in Python is a built-in method used to add an element to the end of a list. It is a straightforward and efficient way to expand a list by appending a new element.

### **Usage**

The `list.append()` method is used in the following format:

```python
list.append(element)
```

- `list`: The list to which you want to add the element.
- `element`: The element you want to append to the list.

---

### **Return Value**

The `list.append()` method does not return a new list but instead modifies the original list by adding the specified element to its end. It returns `None`.

---

### **Examples**

#### **Example 1: Appending an Element**

You can use the `list.append()` method to add an element to the end of the list:

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
fruits.append("orange")

# 'fruits' list is now ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'orange']
```

#### **Example 2: Appending Multiple Elements**

You can also append multiple elements to a list, and they will be added as a single item (a list):

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
numbers.append([4, 5])

# 'numbers' list is now [1, 2, 3, [4, 5]]
```

----

### **Notes**

- The `list.append()` method is efficient for adding elements to the end of a list. It is especially useful when building lists incrementally.
