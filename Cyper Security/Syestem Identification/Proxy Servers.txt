Proxy server: A server that fulfills the request of the clinet by forwarding them on to other severs.

A proxy server is a security system for networks. It acts like a middleman between your network and the internet. When someone wants to connect to your network, the proxy server checks if it's safe. It has a different public address, hiding your network's address, which keeps it safe from bad actors online.

Here's how it works:

1. IP Address Protection: It hides your real IP address, so when people connect to your network, they see a different address. This adds a layer of security.

2. Website Blocking: It can also block access to unsafe websites that shouldn't be visited on your network.

3. Data Storage: It stores frequently requested data, so it doesn't have to keep contacting your network's servers. This makes things faster and more secure.

Tpes of proxies:

- Forward proxy server: (network > internet)
Regulates and restricts person's access to the internet.

- Rerverse proxy server: (internet > internal servrs)
Regulates and restricts the internet's access to an internal server.

This setup is useful for protecting internal web servers containing confidential data from exposing their IP address to external parties.

- An email proxy server is another valuable security tool. It filters spam email by verifying whether a sender's address was forged. This reduces the risk of phishing attacks that impersonate people known to the
