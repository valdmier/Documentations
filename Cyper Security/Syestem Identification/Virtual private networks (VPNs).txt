Virtual Private Networks (VPN):

A network security service that changes your public Ip address and hides your virtual laoction so that you can keep your data private when you are using a public network like the internet.

VPNs also encrypt your data as it travels across the internet to preserve confidentiality.

A VPN service performs encapsulation on your data in transit.

Remote Access vs. Site-to-Site VPNs:

- Remote Access VPNs: These are for individuals. They secure your connection when you're using a personal device to access the internet. They encrypt data and are set up through the internet.

- Site-to-Site VPNs: Big organizations use these to connect multiple offices across the world. IPSec is common here, creating secure tunnels between different networks. They are complex to configure compared to remote VPNs.
