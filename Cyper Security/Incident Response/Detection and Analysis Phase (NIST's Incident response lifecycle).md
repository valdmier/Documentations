# Detection and Analysis Phase (NIST's Incident response lifecycle)

---

## Detection

The prompt discovery of security events.

## Analysis

The <u>investigation</u> and <u>validation</u> of alerts.

---

## Challenges in the detection and analysis phase

- Impossible to detect everything.

- High volume of alerts

---

## Enhancing Threat Detection

Even the best security teams can struggle to detect threats. Automated detection tools are limited by configuration, potentially leaving systems vulnerable. For comprehensive coverage and accuracy, security teams should employ additional methods of detection.

---

## Threat Hunting

- **Proactive Threat Search:** Threat hunting involves actively searching for threats on a network.
- **Human-Driven Detection:** Combines technology with human expertise to find hidden threats.
- **Overcoming Tool Limitations:** Detects malicious activity undetected by automated tools.
- **Early Threat Detection:** Identifies threats before they can cause damage.
- **Effective Against Advanced Threats:** For instance, fileless malware, hard for tools to detect.
- **Role of Threat Hunters:** These specialists research emerging threats, assess vulnerabilities, and use various techniques to discover threats.

----

## Threat Intelligence

- **Understanding Threats:** Organizations need to comprehend the evolving threat landscape and their exposure.
- **Threat Intelligence:** Provides evidence-based information about existing and emerging threats.
- **Sources:** Can come from public or private sources, including industry reports, government advisories, and threat data feeds.
- **Challenge of Managing Data:** Dealing with large volumes of threat intelligence can be a challenge.
- **Threat Intelligence Platforms (TIPs):** These applications centralize, analyze, and prioritize threat data, enhancing security.

## Cyber Deception

- **Deliberate Deception:** Involves deceiving malicious actors to increase detection and enhance defenses.
- **Active Defense Mechanisms:** Examples include honeypots that lure attackers by simulating vulnerabilities.
- **Honeypots:** Systems or resources created as decoys to attract potential intruders.
- **Tricking Malicious Actors:** Deceptive files or resources lead attackers to reveal themselves.
- **Alerting Security Teams:** Once attackers access honeypots, security teams are alerted, allowing for swift action.
