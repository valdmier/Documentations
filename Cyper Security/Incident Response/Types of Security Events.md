# Types of Security Events and Escalation

## Introduction

Security professionals play a critical role in identifying and escalating various incident types to protect an organization's assets and maintain operational integrity. In this document, we explore three distinct incident types, their potential impact, and the importance of escalation.

## 1. Malware Infections

### Understanding Malware

A malware infection is a common incident type involving the infiltration of malicious software into an organization's computer systems or network. Malware comes in various forms, from relatively simple phishing attempts to more complex ransomware attacks.

### Impact and Escalation

Malware infections can disrupt network operations, causing unusual slowdowns and denying access to critical data. Attackers may demand a ransom to unlock data, making this incident particularly impactful due to the sensitive data at stake. Escalating malware infections promptly is crucial to protect the organization's assets and data.

## 2. Unauthorized Access

### Unauthorized Access Overview

Unauthorized access occurs when an individual gains entry, whether digitally or physically, to a system or application without permission. Methods like brute force attacks are used to compromise passwords, login credentials, and encryption keys to access an organization's systems.

### Escalation Importance

Escalation of unauthorized access incidents is vital. The urgency of escalation depends on the criticality of the system in question to the organization's business operations. In this document, we'll explore this aspect in further detail.

## 3. Improper Usage

### Unintentional and Intentional Violations

Improper usage incidents arise when an employee violates the organization's acceptable use policies. These incidents can be unintentional, such as accessing software licenses for personal use or accessing a coworker's data unknowingly violating policy. It may also be intentional, which is more challenging to discern.

### Supervisory Escalation

To address the ambiguity surrounding the intent of improper usage incidents, they should be escalated to a supervisor for evaluation and resolution. Ensuring that violations, whether intentional or unintentional, are addressed is a key part of maintaining a secure working environment.

## Conclusion

Recognizing and escalating these incident types—malware infections, unauthorized access, and improper usage—are fundamental aspects of a security analyst's role. Timely escalation allows organizations to respond effectively, safeguard data, and maintain operational continuity.
