## The triage process (in cybersecurity)

The prioritizing of incidents according to their level of importance or urgency.

## Triage in Healthcare and Security

- **Triage in Healthcare**
  
  - Hospitals receive many patients.
  - Triage categorizes patients by condition urgency.
  - Immediate care for life-threatening cases.
  - Manages limited medical resources.

- **Triage in Security**
  
  - Alerts undergo a triage process in security.
  - Prioritizes incidents by importance and urgency.
  - Limited resources for incident response.
  - Incidents assessed for their threat to system confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

## Triage process

1. **Receive and asses (Alert Assessment)**
   
   - Determine false positives or existing incident connections.
   - Security analyst receives an alert (e.g., from IDS).
   - Verify alert validity and gain a complete understanding.
   - Gather information about the alert, its history, known vulnerabilities, and its severity.
   - Questions to consider:
     - Is it a false positive or a genuine security concern?
     - Has this alert occurred before, and how was it resolved?
     - Is it triggered by a known vulnerability?
     - What is the severity?

2. **Assign priority (Priority Assignment)**
   
   - Prioritize based on impact, size, and scope.
   - Factors to consider:
     - Functional impact on IT systems.
     - Information impact (confidentiality, integrity, availability).
     - Recoverability (cost vs. benefit of recovery).
   - Note: Some alerts come with assigned priority/severity levels.

3. **Collect and analyze (Investigation)**
   
   - Collect and analyze evidence associated with the alert, e.g., system logs.
   - Goal: Gather enough information to make an informed decision.
   - Depending on severity, escalation to a level two analyst or manager may be necessary.

### **Benefits of Triage**

- **Resource Management**
  
  - Focus resources on urgent threats.
  - Avoid wasting time and resources on lower-priority tasks.
  - Potentially reduce response time.

- **Standardized Approach**
  
  - Provides a consistent method for incident handling.
