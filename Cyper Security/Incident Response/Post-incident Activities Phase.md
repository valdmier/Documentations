## Lessons learned meeting (post-mortem)

- Opportunity for learning and improvement after an incident.

- Major incidents, like ransomware attacks, may have dedicated meetings.
- Benefits include cross-departmental information sharing and recommendations for prevention.

  **Pro tip**: Before a team hosts a lessons learned meeting, organizers should make sure all attendees come prepared. The meeting hosts typically develop and distribute a meeting agenda beforehand, which contains the topics of discussion and ensures that attendees are informed and prepared. Additionally, meeting roles should be assigned in advance, including a moderator to lead and facilitate discussion and a scribe to take meeting notes.

  - **Timeline**:Â  A detailed chronological timeline of the incident that includes timestamps dating the sequence of events that led to the incident
  
  - **Investigation**: A compilation of the actions taken during the detection and analysis of the incident. For example, analysis of a network artifact such as a packet capture reveals information about what activities happen on a network.
  
  - **Recommendations**: A list of suggested actions for future prevention
- Consider the audience when writing a final report, as non-technical professionals may read it.
