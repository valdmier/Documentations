## Business Continuity Plan (BCP)

A document that outlines the procedures to sustain business operations during and after a significant disruption.

### **Importance for Entry-Level Security Analysts**

- Entry-level analysts may not develop BCPs but should understand their role in incident response and recovery.

---

### **Distinction: BCP vs. Disaster Recovery Plan**

- BCPs maintain business operations.
- Disaster recovery plans recover information systems after major disasters (e.g., hardware failure, natural disasters).

---

### **Recovery Strategies in BCP**

- BCPs include recovery strategies for returning to normal operations.
- Site resilience: Prepares to respond to and recover from disruptions.

### Resilience

The ability to prepare for, respond to, and recover from disruptions.

### **Site Resilience Types**

An example is site resilience, which is used to ensure the availability of networks, data centers, or other infrastructure when a disruption happens. There are three types of recovery sites used for site resilience:

1. **Hot Sites:** Fully operational, duplicate of the primary environment. Activated immediately on primary site failure.

2. **Warm Sites:** Contains fully updated and configured version of hot site. Not fully operational but quickly made so during failures.

3. **Cold Sites:** Backup facility with some necessary infrastructure. May not be immediately operational and may need additional work during disruptions.
