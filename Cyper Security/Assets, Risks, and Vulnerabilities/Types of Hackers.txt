Types of Hackers:

===
Unauthorized Hackers (Malicious Hackers):

Intent: Commit crimes and exploit vulnerabilities for personal gain or malicious purposes.

Skill Level: Varies widely, from script kiddies (limited skills) to highly skilled hackers.

Often use pre-written code obtained from other hackers.

Example: Individuals engaged in cybercrimes, such as stealing sensitive data or launching cyberattacks.

===
Authorized (Ethical) Hackers:

Intent: Improve an organization's security by identifying vulnerabilities and weaknesses.

Include internal security team members and external security vendors.

Engage in activities like penetration testing and vulnerability assessments.

Example: White-hat hackers, security professionals hired to test and strengthen systems.

===
Semi-Authorized Hackers:

Intent: May violate ethical standards but not necessarily malicious.

Include hacktivists and individuals with political or social motivations.

May expose security risks to raise awareness.

Example: Hacktivists who exploit security vulnerabilities for political causes.

===
Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs):

Definition: APTs are threat actors, often associated with nation-states, that maintain unauthorized access to a system over an extended period.

Objectives: APTs typically surveil targets to gather information for manipulation or espionage purposes.

Targets: Primarily government, defense, financial, and telecom services, but also private organizations.

Stealth: APTs are known for their stealthy and persistent nature.

Access Points: They may target private organizations as a stepping stone to gain access to larger entities.

===
Access Points for Threat Actors:

Threat actors use various attack vectors to gain access to systems and networks.

Attack Vector Categories Include:

- Direct Access: Physical access to a system.

- Removable Media: Portable hardware like USB flash drives.

- Social Media Platforms: Used for communication and sharing.

- Email: Personal and business email accounts.

- Wireless Networks: On-premises Wi-Fi networks.

- Cloud Services: Third-party cloud providers.

- Supply Chains: Third-party vendors and partners.

===
Considerations for Access Points:

Recognizing a threat actor's intent can help identify potential access points and target areas.

For example, remote workers may pose an email-related threat, while physical access threats are more relevant in controlled environments.
