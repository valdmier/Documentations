Symmetric and Asymmetric Encryption

===
Encryption: Process of converting data from readable to encoded format.

Public Key Infrastructure (PKI): Encryption framework for securing online information exchange.

Cipher: Algorithm that encrypts information.

===
Types of Encryption:

===
Symmetric Encryption:

Uses a single secret key for both encryption and decryption.

Requires sender and receiver to know the secret key.

===
Asymmetric Encryption:

Uses a public-private key pair for encryption and decryption.

Public key encrypts data, private key decrypts it.

Private key is given only to authorized users.


===
Importance of Key Length:

- Longer keys are more secure but slower to compute.

- Shorter keys are faster but less secure.

- Balancing speed and security is crucial.

===
Symmetric Algorithms:

===
Triple DES (3DES):

Originated from Data Encryption Standard (DES).

Uses 192-bit keys (three times longer than DES).

Fading in use due to data encryption limitations.

===
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES):

Highly secure symmetric algorithm.

Generates 128, 192, or 256-bit keys.

AES 128-bit key would take billions of years to brute force.

===
Asymmetric Algorithms:

===
Rivest Shamir Adleman (RSA):

Uses public-private key pair.

Key sizes: 1,024, 2,048, or 4,096 bits.

Mainly for highly sensitive data.

===
Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA):

Generates 2,048-bit keys.

Used alongside RSA in public key infrastructure.

===
Generating Keys:

Algorithms implemented using tools like OpenSSL.

OpenSSL used for generating public and private keys.

Regular updates and patching are crucial.

===
Obscurity is Not Security:

Security relies on proven unbreakability.

Kerchoff's Principle: Details of an algorithm (except private key) should be knowable without sacrificing security.

Custom encryption algorithms can be vulnerable when made public.
