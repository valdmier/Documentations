 Asset Management and Classification

===
Asset Management:

Asset management is the process of tracking assets and the risks that affect them. The idea behind this process is simple: you can only protect what you know you have. 

===
1- Asset Inventory:

Asset management begins with creating an asset inventory, a catalog of assets requiring protection.

Benefits: Helps allocate resources efficiently and provides alerts if assets go missing.

2- Asset Classification:

Asset Rating: Asset classification rates assets based on their level of importance and sensitivity.

Definition: It is the practice of labeling assets according to their significance to the organization.

Typical Classifications: Common classifications include 

1- public (shareable with anyone)
This data classification does not need extra security protections. Public data is already accessible to the public and poses a minimal risk to the organization if viewed or shared by others

2- internal-only (shareable within the organization)
This data classification type has a higher security level. Private data is information that should be kept from the public. If an individual gains unauthorized access to private data, that event has the potential to pose a serious risk to an organization. Examples of private data can include company email addresses, employee identification numbers, and an organization’s research data. 

3- confidential (restricted to specific project teams)
This information must be protected from everyone who does not have authorized access. Unauthorized access to sensitive data can cause significant damage to an organization’s finances and reputation. Sensitive data includes personally identifiable information (PII), sensitive personally identifiable information (SPII), and protected health information (PHI). Examples of these types of sensitive data are banking account numbers, usernames and passwords, social security numbers (which U.S. citizens use to report their wages to the government), passwords, passport numbers, and medical information. 

4- restricted (highly sensitive, need-to-know).
This data classification type is important for an organization’s ongoing business operations. Confidential data often has limits on the number of people who have access to it. Access to confidential data sometimes involves the signing of non-disclosure agreements (NDAs)— legal contracts that bind two or more parties to protect information—to further protect the confidentiality of the data. 

Examples of confidential data include proprietary information such as trade secrets, financial records, and sensitive government data.
