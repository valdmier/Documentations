Defense in Depth

===
Defense in depth is a cybersecurity strategy that safeguards information by employing multiple layers of security controls.

These layers serve as barriers to protect data as it moves in and out of the system.

Each layer has distinct security measures and technologies to enhance overall protection.

===
Five Layers of Defense in Depth:

===
1- Perimeter Layer (User Authentication):

Mainly focuses on user authentication.
Utilizes technologies like usernames and passwords.

Filters external access, permitting trusted partners to advance to the next layer.


===
2- Network Layer (Authorization):

Concerned with authorization and network security.

Includes technologies like network firewalls.

Controls access to network resources.

===
3- Endpoint Layer (Device Security):

Addresses the security of devices with network access (e.g., laptops, desktops, servers).

Employs technologies like antivirus software.
Protects devices from threats.

===
4- Application Layer (Interface Security):

Focuses on securing interfaces used to interact with technology.

Security measures are integrated into applications.

Examples include multi-factor authentication, such as password and SMS code verification.

===
5- Data Layer (Critical Data Protection):

Protects sensitive data like personally identifiable information (PII).

Security control, such as asset classification, is crucial.

Safeguards the most critical information.
