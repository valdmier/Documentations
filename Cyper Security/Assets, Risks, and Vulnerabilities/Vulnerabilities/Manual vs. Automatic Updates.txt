Manual vs. Automatic Updates

===
Outdated computer systems and software are vulnerable to security threats, much like a house with unlocked doors.

Software updates, known as patches, are essential for addressing security vulnerabilities and exposures.

Patches often include bug fixes that address common security issues.

===
Common Update Strategies:

===
1. Manual Updates:

Manual deployment relies on users or IT departments obtaining updates from developers.

Small businesses and home users may need to find, download, and install updates themselves.

Enterprises often use configuration management tools for centralized update deployment.


===
Advantage: Control over updates, useful when thorough testing is needed.

Disadvantage: Critical updates can be forgotten or ignored.

===
2. Automatic Updates:

Automatic deployment allows the system or application to find, download, and install updates.

Users or IT groups may need to enable permissions for automatic updates.

===
Advantage: Simplified deployment process, keeps systems current with critical patches.

Disadvantage: Potential instability if patches are not well-tested, leading to performance issues.

End-of-Life (EOL) Software:

- EOL software refers to software that is no longer supported by its developer.

- Software has a lifecycle, starting from production and ending when a newer version is released.

- Developers allocate resources to newer versions, leading to EOL status for older software.

- EOL software poses unfixable security risks, as it no longer receives updates or patches.

CISA recommends discontinuing the use of EOL software to mitigate risks, but replacement can be costly.

- The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices increases the risks associated with unpatched EOL technology.

- A single unpatched IoT device can provide attackers access to a network, highlighting the importance of software updates in an increasingly connected world.
