Vulnerability Management

===
Vulnerabilities and Exploits:

Vulnerabilities are weaknesses in systems that can be exploited by threats.

Exploits are methods used to take advantage of vulnerabilities.

===
Security Planning and Vulnerabilities:

Security teams focus on identifying vulnerabilities and anticipating potential exploits.

Vulnerability management is the process of finding and addressing vulnerabilities to prevent threats.

The process involves four key steps:

- Identify vulnerabilities
- Consider potential exploits
- Prepare defenses against threats
- Evaluate the effectiveness of defenses

Vulnerability management is an ongoing cycle because new vulnerabilities constantly emerge.
===
Zero-Day Exploits:

Zero-day exploits are previously unknown vulnerabilities that are actively exploited.
They leave assets vulnerable to threats without prior planning.
Example: A new form of spyware infecting a popular website.
