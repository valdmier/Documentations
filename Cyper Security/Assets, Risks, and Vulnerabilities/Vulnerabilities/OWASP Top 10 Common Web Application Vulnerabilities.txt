OWASP Top 10: Common Web Application Vulnerabilities

===
Overview:

The OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) is a nonprofit foundation dedicated to improving software security.

The OWASP Top 10 is a list of the most critical web application vulnerabilities.

Organizations use this list to enhance the security of their web applications.

===
Importance and Updates:

The OWASP Top 10 has been published since 2003 to raise awareness about common vulnerabilities.

It applies mainly to new or custom-made software.

Rankings are based on discovery frequency and risk levels.

Auditors reference it for regulatory compliance checks.

===
Vulnerabilities in OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) Top 10:

===
1. Broken Access Control:

Access controls restrict user actions in web apps.
Failures can lead to unauthorized access, disclosure, or modification.

Example: Unauthorized deletion of articles on a blog.

===
2. Cryptographic Failures:

Weak encryption of sensitive data poses risks.
GDPR mandates strong data protection.

Vulnerabilities occur when encryption methods are inadequate (e.g., using MD5).

===
3. Injection:

Injection is inserting malicious code into a vulnerable app.

Attackers exploit weaknesses, often targeting login forms.

Injection can lead to unauthorized access or data theft.

===
4. Insecure Design:

Applications should be designed with security in mind.

Weak design makes apps susceptible to various attacks.

===
5. Security Misconfiguration:

Misconfigurations happen due to improper security settings.

Default settings and unaudited systems are common pitfalls.

Example: Using default settings on network servers.

===
6. Vulnerable and Outdated Components:

Developers use open-source libraries for efficiency.

Apps using unmaintained or vulnerable components are at risk.

===
7. Identification and Authentication Failures:

Authentication failures can lead to unauthorized access.

Apps must correctly identify users and their permissions.

Example: Failing to prevent unauthorized network access.

===
8. Software and Data Integrity Failures:

Inadequate review of updates or patches can lead to vulnerabilities.

Attackers may exploit these weaknesses, leading to supply chain attacks.

Example: SolarWinds cyber attack in 2020.

===
9. Security Logging and Monitoring Failures:

Logging and tracing events are crucial for identifying and fixing problems.

Insufficient monitoring and incident response can lead to undetected threats.

===
10. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):

SSRF manipulates server operations to access unauthorized data.

Vulnerable applications allow malicious code to fetch unauthorized data.

===
The OWASP Top 10 is a valuable resource for addressing common web application vulnerabilities.

Organizations use it to improve software security and regulatory compliance.

Understanding these vulnerabilities is crucial for effective threat prevention and mitigation.
