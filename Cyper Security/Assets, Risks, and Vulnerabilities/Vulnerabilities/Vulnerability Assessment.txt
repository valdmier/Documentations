Vulnerability Assessment

===
Vulnerability assessments are essential for identifying weak points and preventing attacks.
They also help organizations ensure compliance with regulatory standards.

Vulnerability Assessment Process

===
Four Steps of Vulnerability Assessment:

===
1 - Identification (Step 1 - "Taking a Picture"):

In this step, scanning tools and manual testing are used to identify vulnerabilities.

The goal is to understand the current state of the security system.

===
2. Vulnerability Analysis (Step 2 - "Digital Detective"):

This step involves testing each identified vulnerability to determine its source.

The goal is to investigate and pinpoint the root cause of the problems identified in the first step.

===
3. Risk Assessment (Step 3 - "Assigning Scores"):

Vulnerabilities are assigned scores based on two factors:

- Severity of the impact if the vulnerability is exploited.

- The likelihood of exploitation occurring.

Severity x likelihood

Risk assessments help prioritize which vulnerabilities require immediate attention.

===
4. Remediation (Step 4 - "Addressing Vulnerabilities"):

In this final step, vulnerabilities that could impact the organization are addressed.

Remediation actions depend on the severity scores assigned during the risk assessment.

Remediation typically involves collaboration between security and IT teams to determine the best approach.

Examples of remediation steps include implementing new security procedures, updating operating systems, and applying system patches.

Risk assessments help prioritize resources to address vulnerabilities efficiently.
