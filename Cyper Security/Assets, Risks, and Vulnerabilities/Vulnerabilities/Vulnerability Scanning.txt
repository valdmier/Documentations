Vulnerability Scanning

===
Overview:

Vulnerability assessment is an internal security review process to identify weaknesses and prevent attacks.

Vulnerability scanners are essential tools for identifying vulnerabilities in an organization's network and systems.

These tools scan different attack surfaces to find misconfigurations and programming flaws.

Vulnerability databases are updated regularly to improve accuracy.

===
What is a Vulnerability Scanner?

A vulnerability scanner is software that compares known vulnerabilities and exposures against an organization's technologies.

It scans systems to identify misconfigurations or programming flaws.

Scanning tools assess each of the five attack surfaces: Perimeter, Network, Endpoint, Application, and Data layers.

They compare findings against security threat databases and add any discovered vulnerabilities to their reference database.

===
Performing Scans:

Vulnerability scanners are non-intrusive and don't exploit systems.

They alert organizations to potential vulnerabilities.

While non-intrusive, scans can occasionally cause issues such as system crashes.

Different types of scans simulate attacker approaches.

===
Types of Scans:

===
- External vs. Internal Scans:

External scans test the perimeter layer, analyzing outward-facing systems like websites and firewalls.
Internal scans examine an organization's internal systems, such as application software handling user input.

===
- Authenticated vs. Unauthenticated Scans:

Authenticated scans use real user or admin accounts to test for vulnerabilities like broken access controls.
Unauthenticated scans simulate external threats and check if unauthorized access is possible.

===
- Limited vs. Comprehensive Scans:

Limited scans focus on specific devices, searching for misconfigurations or vulnerabilities.

Comprehensive scans analyze all devices connected to a network, including operating systems and user databases.

===
Pro Tips:

Discovery scanning precedes limited or comprehensive scans to identify network devices and open ports.

Vulnerability databases are regularly updated to enhance scanning accuracy.
