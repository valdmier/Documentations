Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)

===
CVE is a crucial resource for identifying and categorizing known vulnerabilities and exposures. 

These terms have a subtle difference: 

a vulnerability: is a system weakness, while 

an exposure: is a mistake exploitable by a threat. 

===
CVE Overview:

Created by MITRE Corporation in 1999, a nonprofit R&D center sponsored by the US government.

Serves as an openly accessible dictionary of vulnerabilities and exposures.

Offers a standardized way to identify and categorize these issues.

===
Criteria for Assigning CVEs:

A vulnerability must be independent of other issues, meaning it can be fixed without addressing other problems.

It should be recognized as a potential security risk by the reporter.

Supporting evidence must accompany the vulnerability report.

The vulnerability should affect only one codebase or program's source code.

===
CVSS Scoring:

CVSS scores vulnerabilities on a scale of 0-10, with 0 being the lowest risk and 10 being the highest.

Scores below 4.0 are considered low risk and may not require immediate attention.

Scores above 9.0 are deemed critical and demand immediate action to protect company assets.

===
Vulnerability Management:

Security teams use CVE references and CVSS scores to prioritize security fixes, such as installing software updates.
