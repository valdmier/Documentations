Principle of least privilege (PoLP)

===
- PoLP grants users the minimum level of access necessary to complete a task or function.

- It supports the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) triad of information security.

===
Limiting Access Reduces Risk:

- It reduces the risk of data theft, misuse, or abuse.

- Limits access to sensitive information.
Reduces chances of accidental data modification, tampering, or loss.

- Supports system monitoring and administration.

- Enhances security by connecting specific resources to users and placing restrictions on their actions.

Determining Access and Authorization:

Two key questions: 
1- "Who is the user?"
2- "How much access do they need to a specific resource?"

Common types of user accounts: 

1- Guest: accounts are provided to external users who need to access an internal network, like customers, clients, contractors, or business partners.

2- User: accounts are assigned to staff based on their job duties.

3- Service: accounts are granted to applications or software that needs to interact with other software on the network.

4- Privileged: accounts have elevated permissions or administrative access.

It's best practice to establish baseline access levels for each account type.

Regular and consistent monitoring of user accounts is essential for maintaining least privilege.

===
Auditing Account Privileges:

Three common approaches to auditing: Usage audits, Privilege audits, Account change audits.

Usage audits review resource access and user actions to ensure compliance with security policies.

Privilege audits address privilege creep, where users accumulate more access privileges than needed.

Account change audits monitor directory services for suspicious activities like unauthorized password changes.

Most directory services can be configured to alert administrators about suspicious activities.
