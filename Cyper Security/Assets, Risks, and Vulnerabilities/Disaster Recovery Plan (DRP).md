## Disaster recovery plan or **Business continuity plan (BCP)**

A **Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)** allows an organization’s security team to outline the steps needed to minimize the impact of a security incident, such as a successful ransomware attack that has stopped the manufacturing team from retrieving certain data. It also helps the security team resolve the security threat. A disaster recovery plan is typically created alongside a business continuity plan. Steps to create a disaster recovery plan should include:

- Implementing recovery strategies to restore software

- Implementing recovery strategies to restore hardware functionality

- Identifying applications and data that might be impacted after a security incident has taken place

## Introduction

**Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)** is a process that ensures a company can restore its operations after an interruption caused by an uncommon and damaging event ¹. The best a company can do is to prepare for it through a strong recovery plan so that it can be ready to face the consequences when a disaster happens. In this document, we will explore what one needs to know about disaster recovery plan development for the CISSP certification exam and what is in a disaster recovery plan.

## What is a recovery plan and what does it contain?

Recovery plans, also known as **business recovery plans (BRPs)**, business continuity plans, or **business contingency plans (BCPs),** are the plans used by a business to maintain or bring back to normal a function or functions lost due to an unscheduled event ¹. Every business unit or department, as well as the business as a whole, should have its own recovery plan, but all the plans should be in accordance with one another. For instance, the IT department refers to the BRP plan first to reactivate its operations and activate the IT continuity plan. Similarly, the BRP gives information to other severely affected departments so that they can activate their own recovery plans.

In general, a recovery plan should include, but is not limited to:

- The organizational unit and its scope and the link of the plan to other plans.
- Roles and responsibilities.
- Thoroughly for contact persons in crisis situations.
- Incident assessment procedures.
- Emergency room contact person.
- Invocation and escalation information.
- Business continuity action plan.
- Recovery profile for each endangered activity.
- Logistics information (equipment, maps and directions).
- Communication matrix.
- Recovery completion procedure.

As a part of the BRP, the disaster recovery plan (DRP) is a specific recovery plan that is concerned particularly with damaged or lost software, data, and/or hardware on one hand, and on overcoming the consequences of that on the other hand. It aims to minimize, as much as possible, potential functional damages caused by a disaster.

## Disaster recovery plan development

The DRP development is the first phase of the disaster recovery management cycle after the project initiation and risk impact assessment. It is an ongoing process of planning, developing, testing, and implementing procedures and processes to ensure that the organization can quickly restart its basic activity after an unplanned interruption due to a disaster ¹. It has the same components as any recovery plan but with particular emphasis on the IT department, personnel, equipment, facilities, and function.
