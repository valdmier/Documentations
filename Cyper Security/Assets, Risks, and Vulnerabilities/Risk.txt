 Risk:

Risk is the possibility of undesirable events or circumstances that may impact an organization's assets, specifically related to the:
- confidentiality
- integrity
- availability 
of those assets.

===
Components of Security Planning:

Security practitioners focus on maintaining the three components of the CIA triad:

- Confidentiality: Ensuring that information is protected from unauthorized access.

- Integrity: Safeguarding the accuracy and reliability of data.

- Availability: Ensuring that systems and data are accessible when needed.

===
Security Risk Planning:

Security risk planning is the initial step in safeguarding these core principles.

Each organization develops its unique security plan based on the specific risks they face.

Basic understanding of how these plans are structured is essential for security practitioners.


===
Analysis of Security Plans:

Security plans are based on analyzing three key elements: 

- assets (what)
- threats (why)
- vulnerabilities (how)

These elements represent the "what, why, and how" of security.

===
Assets:

Assets are items or elements within an organization perceived as valuable.

Examples include buildings, equipment, data, and people.

Prioritization of asset protection is necessary due to the variety of assets and resource limitations.

Security plans allocate resources based on asset value and vulnerability.

===
Risk Equation:

Likelihood x Impact = Risk

Risk is calculated using the formula:

Likelihood (probability of an event)
multiplied
by Impact (severity of the event) equals Risk.

we use this formula to determine the risk priority.

===
Factors in Risk Calculation:

Risk assessment in security revolves around two primary factors:

Threats: Potential circumstances or events that can negatively affect assets.

Vulnerabilities: Weaknesses or flaws within assets that can be exploited by threats.
