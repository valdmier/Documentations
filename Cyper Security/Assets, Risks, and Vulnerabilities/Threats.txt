Threat: Any circumstance or event that can negatively impact assets

===
There are many different types of threats. However, they are commonly categorized as two 

types: 

- intentional 
- unintentional

For example, an intentional threat might be a malicious hacker who gains access to sensitive information by targeting a misconfigured application. An unintentional threat might be an employee who holds the door open for an unknown person and grants them access to a restricted area.
