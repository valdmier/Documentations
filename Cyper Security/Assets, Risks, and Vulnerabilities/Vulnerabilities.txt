Vulnerabilities:

weaknesses within an organization's systems, processes, or assets that can be exploited by threats, leading to various risks and security incidents. Vulnerabilities can be categorized into two main groups: technical and human vulnerabilities.

1. Technical Vulnerabilities:

Definition: Technical vulnerabilities are weaknesses related to technology, software, hardware, and network infrastructure.

Examples:

- Misconfigured software that allows unauthorized access to sensitive data.

- Outdated and unpatched operating systems or applications susceptible to known exploits.
Weak encryption protocols that can be exploited by attackers.

- Inadequate firewall configurations that fail to block unauthorized network access.

2. Human Vulnerabilities:

Definition: Human vulnerabilities pertain to weaknesses associated with human behavior, actions, or errors that can compromise security.

Examples:

- An employee who inadvertently shares sensitive information with unauthorized parties.

- A forgetful staff member who loses their access card or leaves it unattended.
Weak or easily guessable passwords used by employees.

- Falling victim to social engineering attacks, such as phishing or pretexting.
