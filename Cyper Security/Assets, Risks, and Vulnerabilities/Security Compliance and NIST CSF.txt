Security Compliance and NIST Cybersecurity Framework

===
Security Compliance:

Compliance involves adhering to internal standards and external regulations.

==
Highly regulated industries like healthcare, energy, and finance face severe financial and reputational consequences for non-compliance.

===
Regulations:

Regulations are rules established by governments or authorities to control various aspects, including data protection on a larger scale.
Compliance can be complex due to numerous global regulations.

===

Note: Regulations are rules that must be followed, while frameworks are resources you can choose to use.

===
NIST Cybersecurity Framework:

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) is a voluntary framework consisting of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk.

===
Components of NIST CSF:

===
- Core:

The core defines five broad functions: 

- identify: UNKOWN DEVICE COONECTED.
- protect: BLOCK THE DEVIECE.
- detect: DETECT ANY DAMAGES CAUSED.
- respond: INVISTIGATING THE INCIDENT.
- recover: RECOVER WHATEVER WAS INNFECTED.

These functions serve as a security checklist.

===
- Tiers:

Tiers provide a way to measure performance across the five core functions.

Tiers range from Level-1 (bare minimum standards) to Level-4 (exemplary standards).

CSF tiers are used to assess an organization's security posture.

===
- Profiles:

Profiles offer insights into the current state of a security plan.

They are akin to capturing a moment in time, allowing for comparisons over time.

Profiles help organizations understand how their security measures change and adapt.
