SSO, MFA, and Strengthening Authentication

===
SSO (Single Sign-On):

SSO combines multiple logins into one, benefiting companies for three main reasons:

- Experience: Improves the user experience by reducing the number of usernames and passwords to remember.

- Cost: Lowers costs by simplifying service management.

- Security: Enhances security by reducing potential access points for attackers.

SSO technology emerged in the mid-1990s to combat password fatigue, where people reuse passwords across services, which is a security risk.

SSO shifts authentication responsibility away from users.

===
How SSO Works:

SSO automates trust establishment between users and service providers.

Trusted third-parties validate users' identities through encrypted access tokens exchanged between identity providers and service providers.

Common authentication protocols used in SSO are LDAP (on-premises) and SAML (off-premises, cloud).

LDAP and SAML protocols are often used together for SSO.

SSO connects users to multiple applications with a single access token.

===
Limitations of SSO:

SSO, relying on usernames and passwords, may not provide the highest level of security.

A lost or stolen password could expose multiple services.

===
MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication):

MFA requires users to verify their identity using two or more factors, enhancing security.

MFA combines multiple forms of identification for authentication.

Factors include:

- Knowledge: Something the user knows (e.g., username, password).

- Ownership: Something the user has (e.g., a one-time passcode sent via SMS).

- Charactristic: Something the user is (e.g., fingerprints, facial scans).

MFA strengthens authentication, especially in cloud environments, by making it challenging for threat actors to impersonate users.
