Databases 


===
Definition: An organized collection of information or data.


===
Relational Databases

Definition: Structured databases containing related tables.

===
Table Components:

Columns (Fields): Define attributes (e.g., employee_id).

Rows (Records): Contain specific data related to columns.

===
Table Relationships: Connect tables using keys (e.g., employee_id).

Primary Key: Unique, no duplicates, identifies each row.

Foreign Key: Links to primary key in another table.

A table can have one primary key but multiple foreign keys.

===
A query: 

request for data from a database table or a combination of tables 


===
SQL vs. Linux Filtering

Accessing SQL from Linux:

Use SQL commands for specific SQL versions (e.g., sqlite3).

Execute SQL commands via the Linux command line.

===
Differences:

===
Structure:

- SQL offers organized, column-based data.
- Linux presents data as unstructured text lines.

===
Joining Tables:

- SQL allows joining multiple tables for complex queries.
- Linux lacks this functionality, making it less suitable for complex data analysis.

===
Best Uses:
- SQL is preferred for structured data in databases.
- Linux is useful for unstructured data or data in incompatible formats (e.g., text files).
