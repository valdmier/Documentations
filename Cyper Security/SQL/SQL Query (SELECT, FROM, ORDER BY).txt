SQL Query (SELECT, FROM, ORDER BY)

===
SQL Query Essentials:

Two essential keywords: SELECT and FROM.
SELECT: Specifies which columns to return.
FROM: Indicates the table to query.


===
Sample SQL Query:

SELECT employee_id, device_id
FROM employees;


===
Using SELECT:

You can select one or more columns by separating them with commas.

Example: 

SELECT customerid, city

To select all columns, use an asterisk (*).

Example:

 SELECT *

Note: Be cautious with SELECT * for large databases as it may slow down queries.

===
Using FROM:

Use the FROM keyword followed by the table name.

Example:

 FROM customers

End the query with a semicolon (;).


===
ORDER BY Keyword:

Used to sort query results.

Default order is ascending (e.g., from smallest to largest).

Example of sorting in ascending order by "city":

SELECT customerid, city, country
FROM customers
ORDER BY city;

It will sort alphabetically or from largest num to smallest.

Example of sorting in descending order by "city":

SELECT customerid, city, country
FROM customers
ORDER BY city DESC;

===
Sorting Based on Multiple Columns:

You can sort by multiple columns, e.g., by "country" and then "city."


SELECT customerid, country, city
FROM customers
ORDER BY country, city;


SQL first sorts by "country," and within each country, it sorts by "city."
