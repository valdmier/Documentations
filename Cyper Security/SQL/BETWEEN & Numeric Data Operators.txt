BETWEEN & Other Numeric Data Operators


===
Operators for Filtering Dates and Numbers

- Security analysts deal with various data types, including numeric and date/time data.

- Numeric data examples:
  - Number of login attempts
  - Count of specific log entries
  - Data volume sent from a source
  - Data volume sent to a destination

- Date and time data examples:
  - Timestamps in logs
  - Login dates and times
  - Patch dates
  - Connection durations

===
Comparison Operators

- SQL uses comparison operators for numeric and date/time filtering.

| Operator | Use                  |
|----------|----------------------|
| <        | Less than            |
| >        | Greater than         |
| =        | Equal to             |
| <=       | Less than or equal   |
| >=       | Greater than or equal|
| <>       | Not equal to         |

- You can use `!=` as an alternative for "not equal to."


===
Using Operators in Filters

- Operators are applied in the `WHERE` clause at the end of a query.

- Example using the `>` operator:
  ```sql
  SELECT firstname, lastname, birthdate
  FROM employees
  WHERE birthdate > '1970-01-01';
  ```
  - Returns employees born after '1970-01-01' (exclusive).
  - Using `>=` would include results on '1970-01-01' (inclusive).


===
BETWEEN Operator

- The `BETWEEN` operator filters for numbers or dates within a range.

- Example: Finding employees hired between January 1, 2002, and January 1, 2003.
  
  SELECT firstname, lastname, hiredate
  FROM employees
  WHERE hiredate BETWEEN '2002-01-01' AND '2003-01-01';
 
  - The `BETWEEN` operator is inclusive, including the start and end dates in the results.
