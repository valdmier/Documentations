AND, OR, and NOT

Logical operators, including AND, OR, and NOT, are essential tools in SQL for precise data filtering.

===
AND Operator

AND is used to filter based on two conditions simultaneously, requiring both conditions to be met for a row to be included in the results.

Example: To find customer accounts handled by support representative ID 5 located in the USA, use:

SELECT firstname, lastname, email, country, supportrepid

FROM customers

WHERE supportrepid = 5 AND country = 'USA';

===
OR Operator

The OR operator connects two conditions and returns results where either the first, second, or both conditions are met.

Example: To find customers in the USA or Canada for a security update communication, use:

SELECT firstname, lastname, email, country
FROM customers
WHERE country = 'Canada' OR country = 'USA';


===
NOT Operator

NOT negates a single condition, returning all records that don't match the specified condition in the query.

Example: To find customers not located in the USA, use:

SELECT firstname, lastname, email, country
FROM customers
WHERE NOT country = 'USA';

Pro tip: You can also use the <> or != operators to find values not equal to a certain value, like: WHERE country <> 'USA' or WHERE country != 'USA'.

example:

SELECT * FROM log_in_attempts WHERE NOT country LIKE 'MEX%';
===
Combining Logical Operators

Logical operators can be combined in filters for more complex queries. For example, to find customers in countries other than the USA and Canada, use:

SELECT firstname, lastname, email, country
FROM customers
WHERE NOT country = 'Canada' AND NOT country = 'USA';


===
SELECT *
FROM log_in_attempts
WHERE login_date = '2022-05-09' 
OR
login_date = '2022-05-08';
