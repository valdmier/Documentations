 Inner Joins and Outer Joins

===
Inner Joins

- An INNER JOIN returns rows matching on a specified column that exists in more than one table.

- It only returns rows where there is a match.

- All specified columns from all joined tables are returned.

- When using SELECT *, a column existing in both tables is returned twice.

===
Syntax of an Inner Join
- To use INNER JOIN:

  - Specify the two tables to join.
  - Use the ON keyword and the = operator to indicate the column for joining.

  - Specify both table and column names by placing a period (.) between them.

===
Selecting Specific Columns in an Inner Join**
- You can select specific columns:

  SELECT username, operating_system, employees.device_id
  FROM  employees
  INNER JOIN machines ON employees.device_id = machines.device_id;

==
  - Specify both table and column names if the column exists in both tables.

===
Outer Joins

- Outer joins return all rows from one table or both tables.

===
Left Join

- LEFT JOIN returns all records from the first table and matching rows from the second table.
- Syntax:
  
  SELECT *
  FROM employees
  LEFT JOIN machines ON employees.device_id = machines.device_id;
  
- Specify the first or left table after FROM and the second or right table after LEFT JOIN.

- All records from the left table and matching records from the right table are returned.

===
Right Join

- RIGHT JOIN returns all records from the second table and matching rows from the first table.

- Syntax is the same as LEFT JOIN, but it produces different output.

- You can switch table order to achieve the same result:
  
  SELECT *
  FROM machines
  RIGHT JOIN employees ON employees.device_id = machines.device_id;
  
===
Full Outer Join

- FULL OUTER JOIN returns all records from both tables, merging them entirely.

- Syntax:
  
  SELECT *
  FROM employees
  FULL OUTER JOIN machines ON employees.device_id = machines.device_id;

==
- Order of tables doesn't affect results.

Key Takeaways

- In SQL, various ways to join tables.

- INNER JOIN returns matching records.

- Outer joins (LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN) return all or some unmatched records.

- LEFT JOIN returns all from the left table and matching from the right.

- RIGHT JOIN returns all from the right table and matching from the left.

- FULL OUTER JOIN merges all records from both tables.
