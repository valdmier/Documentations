WHERE Clause, LIKE Operator, and Wildcards

===
Filtering with WHERE Clause:

- As a security analyst, filtering is essential for working with large and complex security logs.

- The WHERE keyword is used to create a filter in SQL.

- WHERE indicates the condition for a filter in a query.

Example:

SELECT firstname, lastname, title, email
FROM employees
WHERE title = 'IT Staff';

This query filters the results to only include employees with the title 'IT Staff'.

===
Filtering for Patterns:

SQL allows you to filter based on patterns, such as entries that start or end with specific characters.

Filtering for patterns requires two elements in the WHERE clause: a wildcard and the LIKE operator.

===
Wildcards:

Wildcards are special characters that can be substituted with other characters.

Two useful wildcards are % (percentage sign) and _ (underscore):

%: Substitutes for any number of characters.
_: Substitutes for a single character.


===
Examples of Wildcards:

'a%': Matches strings that start with 'a' (e.g., 'apple123', 'art').

'a_': Matches strings where 'a' is followed by one character (e.g., 'as', 'an', 'a7').

'a__': Matches strings where 'a' is followed by two characters (e.g., 'ant', 'add', 'a1c').

'%a': Matches strings that end with 'a' (e.g., 'pizza', 'Z6ra', 'a').

'_a': Matches strings where 'a' is preceded by one character (e.g., 'ma', '1a', 'Ha').

'%a%': Matches strings that contain 'a' anywhere in the string (e.g., 'Again', 'back', 'a').

'a': Matches strings where 'a' is surrounded by one character on each side (e.g., 'Car', 'ban', 'ea7').

===
Using the LIKE Operator:

To apply wildcards in your filter, use the LIKE operator instead of the equals sign (=).
LIKE is used with the WHERE clause to search for patterns in a column.

Example:
SELECT lastname, firstname, title, email
FROM employees
WHERE title LIKE 'IT%';

This query filters employees with titles starting with 'IT', such as 'IT Staff' and 'IT Manager'.

Remember to use the semicolon (;) to end your SQL query.
