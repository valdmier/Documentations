Common Social Engineering Tactics:

===
Baiting:

Tempts individuals into compromising security.
Example: Leaving infected USB drives in public areas for someone to find and plug into their device.

===
Phishing:

Utilizes digital communications (e.g., emails) to deceive individuals into revealing sensitive data or installing malicious software.
One of the most common forms of social engineering.

===
Quid Pro Quo:

Offers false rewards (e.g., discounts, benefits) in exchange for access, information, or money.
Attackers impersonate trustworthy entities (e.g., banks, service providers) to obtain sensitive data.

===
Tailgating (Piggybacking):

Unauthorized individuals follow authorized personnel into restricted areas.
Takes advantage of physical security lapses.

===
Watering Hole:

Attackers compromise websites frequently visited by specific user groups.
These websites are infected with malicious software, targeting unsuspecting visitors.


===
Signs of a Social Engineering Attack:

===
- Stay Alert: Be cautious of suspicious communications and unknown contacts, especially in emails. Check for spelling errors and verify sender information.

===
- Exercise Caution: Be careful about sharing information, particularly on social media platforms, where attackers may gather information for their schemes.

===
- Control Curiosity: Avoid clicking on attachments or links in emails or advertisements that seem too good to be true.

===
Mitigating Social Engineering Threats:

Security Training: Comprehensive security training for employees and customers is essential.

Technology: Implement security technologies like firewalls, multi-factor authentication (MFA), email filtering, and blocklists to augment defenses.

Spread Awareness: Extend security awareness beyond employees to customers and stakeholders.
