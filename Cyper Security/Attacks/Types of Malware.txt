Types of Malware:

===
Virus: Malicious code designed to interfere with computer operations and damage data and software. It requires user installation and can be spread through tactics like phishing campaigns.

===
Worm: Malware that can self-duplicate and spread across systems independently. Like viruses, worms require user installation but can also spread through malicious emails.

===
Trojan: Also known as a Trojan horse, it disguises itself as legitimate files or programs. Trojans are spread through deceptive downloads, tricking users into installing malware that can spy on them or grant unauthorized access.

===
Adware: Legitimate software used for displaying digital advertisements in applications. However, malicious adware is a type of potentially unwanted application (PUA) that can install additional software without user consent.

===
Spyware: Malware used to gather and sell information without consent. It's also considered a PUA and is commonly hidden in bundleware.

===
Scareware: A type of PUA that uses fake warnings to frighten users into infecting their devices. It spreads through emails and pop-ups.

===
Fileless Malware: Does not need user installation and resides in memory, making it stealthier than other types. Detection requires memory analysis.

===
Rootkit: Provides remote administrative access to a computer and is often spread through a dropper and loader. A dropper disguises itself as a legitimate file, while a loader downloads and installs malicious code from an external source.

===
Botnet: A network of infected computers controlled by a single threat actor. Botnets are used for various purposes, including launching attacks or spreading malware.

===
Ransomware: Encrypts an organization's data and demands payment for decryption. Ransomware attacks are on the rise and can cause significant damage.
