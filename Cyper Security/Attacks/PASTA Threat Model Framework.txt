PASTA Threat Model Framework

===
PASTA (Process of Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis) is a comprehensive framework for systematically addressing security concerns during application development and maintenance.

===
Stage 1: Define Business and Security Objectives

Determine goals and objectives, e.g., protecting customer data.

Ask questions about data handling and personally identifiable information.

Evaluate the impact of potential threats.

===
Stage 2: Define Technical Scope

Identify the components to be evaluated (attack surface).

Include technology related to data at rest and in use.

Encompass network protocols, security controls, and data interactions.

===
Stage 3: Decompose the Application

Identify existing controls safeguarding user data.

Work with developers to create a data flow diagram.

Illustrate the data's journey from user devices to the company's database.

===
Stage 4: Perform Threat Analysis

Adopt an attacker mindset.

Collect up-to-date information on attack types.

Reference resources to stay current as attack vectors evolve.

===
Stage 5: Perform Vulnerability Analysis

Investigate potential vulnerabilities and their root causes.

===
Stage 6: Conduct Attack Modeling

Simulate attacks to test vulnerabilities analyzed in Stage 5.

Create an attack tree, resembling a flow chart.

Identify attack vectors for testing and validation.

Example: An attack tree for a mobile app may include SQL injection as an attack vector.

===
Stage 7: Analyze Risk and Impact

Compile information from Stages 1 to 6.

Make informed risk management recommendations aligned with business goals.
