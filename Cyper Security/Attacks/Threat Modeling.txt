Threat Modeling

===
Step 1: Define Scope

Create an inventory of assets and classify them.
Determine the scope of the threat model.

===
Step 2: Identify Threats

Define potential threat actors, either internal or external.
Examples: Malicious employees or hackers.

===
Step 3: Create Attack Tree

Develop a detailed diagram mapping threats to assets.
Ensures comprehensive understanding before proceeding.

===
Step 4: Characterize Environment

Apply an attacker's perspective to the business environment.
Consider customer, employee, external partner, and vendor interactions.

===
Step 5: Analyze Threats

Examine existing security measures and identify gaps.
Assign risk scores to rank threats.

===
Step 6: Mitigate Risk

Develop a plan to defend against threats.
Choose to avoid, transfer, reduce, or accept risk.

===
Step 7: Evaluate Findings

Document all actions taken during the exercise.
Apply fixes as needed and document successes and lessons learned for future threat models.

===
Importance of Threat Modeling

Ideally, threat modeling should be performed before, during, and after software development.

It evaluates various aspects, including architecture and business purposes.

Integral throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC).

===
Common Threat Modeling Frameworks

===
STRIDE (Microsoft):

Identifies vulnerabilities in six attack vectors: Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege.

===
PASTA (Process of Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis):

Risk-centric threat modeling process.
Focuses on discovering viable threats and modeling them.
Incorporates security artifacts like vulnerability assessment reports.

===
Trike (Open Source):

Security-centric approach to threat modeling.
Emphasizes security permissions, application use cases, privilege models, and more.

===
VAST (Visual, Agile, and Simple Threat Modeling):

Part of an automated threat-modeling platform called ThreatModelerÂ®.
Streamlines threat modeling assessments.

===
Participating in Threat Modeling

Often led by experienced security professionals.
Collaboration is crucial, especially for complex applications.

Key Questions:

What are we working on?

What could go wrong?

What mitigation strategies are in place?

Have all aspects been addressed?

Is the threat model effective?

Note: Threat modeling is a skill that can be learned and improved over time, and it involves various techniques such as data flow diagrams and attack trees.
