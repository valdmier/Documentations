SQL Injection Categories

===
In-band SQL Injection

In-band SQL injection is the most common type.
Attacker uses the same channel for the attack and to retrieve results.
Example: A vulnerable search box on a retailer's website where an attacker enters a malicious query, causing the database to return sensitive information, displayed in the same search box.

===
Out-of-band SQL Injection

Involves a different communication channel for the attack and results.
Rare due to specific target server requirements.
Example: Attacker establishes a connection between a vulnerable website and their controlled database, bypassing security controls on the website's server, enabling data theft.

===
Inferential SQL Injection

Attacker can't directly see results but interprets them from system behavior.
Example: An attack on a login form results in an error message, revealing database structure. Attacker crafts further attacks to access data or gain control.

===
Injection Prevention

SQL queries assume user inputs are relevant and safe.
Prevent injection by escaping user inputs to prevent unexpected code insertion.

Prevention methods:

- Prepared Statements: Execute SQL statements before passing them to the database.

- Input Sanitization: Remove user input that could be code.

- Input Validation: Ensure user input meets system expectations.
