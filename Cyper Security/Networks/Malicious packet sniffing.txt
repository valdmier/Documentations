Preventing Malicious Packet Sniffing

- Use VPN (Virtual Private Network):

Encrypts and protects data on the network.
Makes it unreadable and unable to be decoded for hackers even if they intercept it.

- Ensure Websites Use HTTPS:

HTTPS encrypts data with SSL/TLS.
Safeguards against eavesdropping by malicious actors.

- Avoid Unprotected Public WiFi:

Public WiFi in places like coffee shops lacks encryption.
Data is accessible to anyone on the network.
Use it cautiously or with a VPN already installed for added security.
