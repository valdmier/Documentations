IP addresses are used to communicate over a network.

 IP stands for: internet protocol.

 An internet protocol address, or IP address, is a unique string of characters that identifies a location of a device on the internet.

 Each device on the internet has a unique IP address, just like every house on a street has its own mailing address.

there are two types of IP addreses:

- IP version 4 (IPV4), example: 19.117.63.126

- IP version 6 (IPv6), example: 
2001:0D3B:AC20:BE02:0000:0000:0000:0000

IPv4 addresses are written as four, 1, 2, or 3-digit numbers separated by a decimal point. In the early days of the internet, IP addresses were all IPV4. But as the use of the internet grew, all the IPv4 addresses started to get used up, so IPv6 was developed.

IPv6 addresses are made up of 32 characters. The length of the IPv6 address will allow for more devices to be connected to the internet without running out of addresses as quickly as IPv4.

===
IP addresses come in two types: public and private.

Your internet service provider assigns a public IP address, which is linked to your location. 

When your devices connect to the internet, they share this public address, similar to housemates sharing a mailing address.

However, within your local network, devices use private IP addresses that are invisible to the broader internet. This allows devices on your home network to communicate uniquely while remaining hidden from the outside world.

There are 13 fields within the header of an IPv4 packet:

Version (VER): This 4 bit component tells receiving devices what protocol the packet is using. The packet used in the illustration above is an IPv4 packet.

IP Header Length (HLEN or IHL): HLEN is the packetâ€™s header length. This value indicates where the packet header ends and the data segment begins. 

Type of Service (ToS): Routers prioritize packets for delivery to maintain quality of service on the network. The ToS field provides the router with this information.

Total Length: This field communicates the total length of the entire IP packet, including the header and data. The maximum size of an IPv4 packet is 65,535 bytes.

Identification: For IPv4 packets that are larger than 65, 535 bytes, the packets are divided, or fragmented, into smaller IP packets. The identification field provides a unique identifier for all the fragments of the original IP packet so that they can be reassembled once they reach their destination. 

Flags: This field provides the routing device with more information about whether the original packet has been fragmented and if there are more fragments in transit.

Fragmentation Offset: The fragment offset field tells routing devices where in the original packet the fragment belongs.

Time to Live (TTL): TTL prevents data packets from being forwarded by routers indefinitely. It contains a counter that is set by the source. The counter is decremented by one as it passes through each router along its path. When the TTL counter reaches zero, the router currently holding the packet will discard the packet and return an ICMP Time Exceeded error message to the sender. 

Protocol: The protocol field tells the receiving device which protocol will be used for the data portion of the packet.

Header Checksum: The header checksum field contains a checksum that can be used to detect corruption of the IP header in transit. Corrupted packets are discarded.

Source IP Address: The source IP address is the IPv4 address of the sending device.

Destination IP Address: The destination IP address is the IPv4 address of the destination device.

Options: The options field allows for security options to be applied to the packet if the HLEN value is greater than five. The field communicates these options to the routing devices.
