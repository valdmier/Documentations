Denial of Service (DoS) attacks:

 An attack that targets a network or server and floods it with network traffic. 

The goal of the attack is to send so much information to a network device that it crashes or is unable to respond to legitimate users.

A network crash can also leave them vulnerable to other security threats and attacks.


===
A distributed denial of service attack (DDoS):

A kind of DoS attack that uses multiple devices or servers in different locations to flood the target network with unwanted traffic.

===
Remember, DoS stands for denial of service. So it doesn't matter what part of the network the attacker overloads; if they overload anything, they win.  



===
Types of DoS attacks:

===
- SYN (synchronize) flood attack: 

A type of DoS attack that simulates a TCP connection and floods a server with SYN packets.


---
Let's break this definition down a bit more by taking a closer look at the handshake process that is used to establish a TCP connection between a device and a server:

Establishing a TCP connection involves a handshake. First, the device sends a SYN request to the server. The server replies with a SYN/ACK, leaving a port open. When it gets the final ACK from the device, the connection is made.

Hackers flood servers with SYN requests, overwhelming them if it exceeds available ports, causing the server to fail.

===
ICMP flood attack:

An ICMP flood attack is a type of DoS attack performed by an attacker repeatedly sending ICMP packets to a network server. This forces the server to send an ICMP packet. This eventually uses up all the bandwidth for incoming and outgoing traffic and causes the server to crash.

---
ICMP is an internet protocol used by devices to tell each other about data transmission errors across the network.

ICMP is like a request for a status update from a device. The device will return error messages if there is a network concern.


===
There are also attacks that can overwhelm the server with one big request. 

 One example that we'll discuss is called the ping of death.

===
-Ping of death:

Caused when a hacker pings a system by sending it an oversized ICMP packet that is bigger than 64 kilobytes, the maximum size for a correctly formed ICMP packet. 


===
- Smurf attack: 

A combination of a DDoS attack and an IP spoofing attack. The attacker sniffs an authorized user's IP address and floods it with packets. This overwhelms the target computer and can bring down a server or the entire network.
