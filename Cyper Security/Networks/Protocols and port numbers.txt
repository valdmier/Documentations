Protocols and port numbers:

are like addresses and labels for data packets in computer networks. They help devices know what to do with the information they receive. Think of them as postcodes on letters. Firewalls act like gatekeepers and can block or allow data based on these codes. For example, a company might only let data with a specific code (like TCP port 995 for POP3) from their own addresses get through.

As a security analyst, it's important to remember these codes because they can be used to test your knowledge in interviews. Plus, you'll keep learning about new codes on the job to keep networks secure.
