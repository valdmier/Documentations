three-way handshake:

===
The handshake consists
of three steps:

1. A SYN packet is sent from the source to the destination, requesting to
connect.

2. The destination replies to the source with a SYN-ACK packet to accept
the connection request. The destination will reserve resources for the
source to connect.

3. A final ACK packet is sent from the source to the destination
acknowledging the permission to connect.
