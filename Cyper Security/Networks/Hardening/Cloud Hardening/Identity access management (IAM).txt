Identity Access Management (IAM)

Definition:

- IAM involves processes and technologies for managing digital identities.

- It authorizes user access to cloud resources.

===
Common Problem:

Loose configuration of cloud user roles is a common issue.

It increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical cloud operations.

===
User Experience:

- IAM improves user experience by enabling single sign-on (SSO).

- Users can access multiple services with one set of credentials, reducing password management hassles.
