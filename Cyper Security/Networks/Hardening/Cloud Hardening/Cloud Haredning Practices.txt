Cloud Haredning Practices:

===
Cloud network:

 a collection of servers or computers that stores resources and data in a remote data center that can be accessed via the internet.


===
Cloud Network Basics:

- Cloud networks store resources and data in remote data centers accessible via the internet.

- They offer on-demand storage, processing power, and data analytics.

Security Hardening in the Cloud:

- Cloud servers, like traditional ones, require proper maintenance and security measures.

- Cloud providers can't prevent intrusions from malicious actors.

===
1- Server Baseline Image:

- Unique to cloud network hardening.

- A baseline image is used for all cloud server instances.

- It helps detect unverified changes that could result from intrusions.

===
2- Isolation of Data and Applications:

Data and applications in the cloud are separated based on service categories.

Old and new applications are kept separate.

Internal software is isolated from user-facing applications (front-end).
