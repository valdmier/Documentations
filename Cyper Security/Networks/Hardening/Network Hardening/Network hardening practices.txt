Network Hardening: Regular and Occasional Tasks


===
Regular Tasks:

- Firewall Rules Maintenance: Ongoing management of firewall rules to control network traffic.

- Network Log Analysis: The process of examining network logs to identify events of interest. Security teams use a log analyzer tool or a security information and event management tool (SIEM) to conduct network log analysis.

- Patch Updates: Regularly updating software and systems to address security vulnerabilities.

- Server Backups: Routine backup of servers to safeguard data and facilitate recovery.


===
Occasional Tasks:

- Port Filtering: Firewall function that blocks or allows certain port numbers to limit unwanted communication. " The only ports that are needed are the ones that are allowed. "

- Network Access Privileges: Management of user access rights to maintain security.

- Encryption for Communication: Ensuring secure data transmission through encryption protocols.
Wireless Protocol Management: Using up-to-date wireless protocols and disabling older, less secure ones.

- Network Segmentation: Creating isolated subnets for different departments to limit the scope of potential threats.

- Security Zone Separation: Isolating highly classified or confidential data from the rest of the network.

- Data Encryption Standards: Applying robust encryption standards, especially for data in restricted zones.
