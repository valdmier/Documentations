OS hardening frequency:

Some OS hardening are done

- at regular intervals  (updates, backups)

- Only once (Encryption)


===
OS hardening practices:


===
- Patch Update

A software and operating system update that adresses security vulnerabilities within a program or product.

As soon as OS vendors publish a patch and the vulnerability fix, malicious actors know exactly where the vulnerability is in systems running the out-of-date OS.

Practice: 

This is why it's important for organizations to run patch updates as soon as they are released.

===
- Baseline configuration:

 is a documented set of specifications within a system that is used as a basis for future builds, releases, and updates.

For example, a baseline may contain a firewall rule with a list of allowed and disallowed network ports.

Practice:  

If a security team suspects unusual activity affecting the OS, they can compare the current configuration to the baseline and make sure that nothing has been changed.


===
- Hardware and software disposal:

 Removing unused software makes sure that there aren't any unnecessary vulnerabilities connected with the programs that the software uses.


===
- Implementing a strong password policy:

a password policy usually states that a user will lose access to the network after entering the wrong password a certain number of times in a row.

Some systems also require multi-factor authentication, or MFA.

MFA:

is a security measure which requires a user to verify their identity in two or more ways to access a system or network. 

===
Categories of multi-factor identification:

- Something you know

- Something you have

- Somehting unique about you (personal info, biometrics)
