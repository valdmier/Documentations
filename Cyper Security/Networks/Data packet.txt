Data packet:

A basic unit of information that travels from one device to another within a network.

==
When data is sent from one device to another across a network, it is sent as a packet that contains information about:

- where the packet is going
- where it's coming from
- the content of the message.

===
A data packet is very similar to a physical letter. It contains:

- Header:
 IP adress / MAC adress / Protcol Number

- Body: 
 The message that needs to be trasmitted.

- Footer:
 Signals that the packet is finished

===

The flow and the movement of data packets through the network provides an indication on how well the network is preforming.

 Network performance can be measured by bandwidth

===
Bandwidth:

refers to the amount of data a device receives every second.

--
 You can calculate bandwidth by dividing the quantity of data by the time in seconds.

 Speed refers to the rate at which data packets are received or downloaded.

Security personnel are interested in network bandwidth and speed because if either are irregular, it could be an indication of an attack.

Packet sniffing:

THe practice of captuaring and inspecting data packets across a network.
