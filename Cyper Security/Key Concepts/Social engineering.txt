Social engineering is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables.

 Human error is usually a result of trusting someone without question. Itâ€™s the mission of a threat actor, acting as a social engineer, to create an environment of false trust and lies to exploit as many people as possible. 

Some of the most common types of social engineering attacks today include:

Social media phishing: 
A threat actor collects detailed information about their target from social media sites. Then, they initiate an attack.

Watering hole attack: 
A threat actor attacks a website frequently visited by a specific group of users.

USB baiting: 
A threat actor strategically leaves a malware USB stick for an employee to find and install, to unknowingly infect a network. 

Physical social engineering: 
A threat actor impersonates an employee, customer, or vendor to obtain unauthorized access to a physical location.
