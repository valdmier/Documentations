The confidentiality, integrity, availability (CIA) triad is a model that helps inform how organizations consider risk when setting up systems and security policies.
===

C - Confidentiality:

is the idea that only authorized users can access specific assets or data. In an organization, confidentiality can be enhanced through the implementation of design principles, such as the principle of least privilege. 

*The principle of least privilege limits users' access to only the information they need to complete work-related tasks. Limiting access is one way of maintaining the confidentiality and security of private data. 

I - Integrity:
Data is correct, authentic, and reliable.

The idea that the data is verifiably correct, authentic, and reliable. Having protocols in place to verify the authenticity of data is essential.

A - Availability:
Data is accessible to those who are authorized to access it.

Maintaining an acceptable level of risk and ensuring systems and policies are designed with these elements in mind helps establish a successful security posture, which refers to an organizationâ€™s ability to manage its defense of critical assets and data and react to change.
