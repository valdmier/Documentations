The web is actually an interlinked network of online content that's made up of three layers: the surface web, the deep web, and the dark web.

==
- The surface web:
the layer that most people use. It contains content that can be accessed using a web browser.

- The deep web generally requires authorization to access it. An organization's intranet is an example of the deep web, since it can only be accessed by employees or others who have been granted access.

- Lastly, the dark web can only be accessed by using special software. The dark web generally carries a negative connotation since it is the preferred web layer for criminals because of the secrecy that it provides.
