**Computer Process Overview:**

**1. User**
- Initiates the computer process with a specific task in mind.
- Example: You, as a user, accessing this reading.


===
2. Application
- The software program users interact with to complete tasks.
- Examples: Calculator application for calculations, word processing application for writing reports.
- Second part of the process.

===
3. Operating System (OS)
- Receives the user's request from the application.
- Interprets and directs the request's flow.
- Sends the request to applicable hardware components.
- Critical in completing tasks but often works behind the scenes.
- Analogous to a restaurant kitchen in terms of processing requests.

===
4. Hardware
- Performs processing tasks to fulfill user requests.
- Examples: CPU for calculations, hard drive for saving files.
- Sends output back to the OS for display to the user.


===
Example: Downloading a File from an Internet Browser

- **User Decision:** User wants to download an online file, clicks on the download button in the internet browser.

- **Internet Browser:** Communicates the download action to the OS.

- **Operating System (OS):**
  - Receives the download request.
  - Directs the request to the appropriate hardware for processing.

- **Hardware:**
  - Initiates the download process.
  - Communicates download progress to the OS.

- **Internet Browser:**
  - Informs the user when the file download is complete.

**Overall Analogy:**
- The computer process is similar to ordering food at a restaurant.
- User's specific requests are like food orders.
- Hardware processing is analogous to kitchen work.
- The OS functions behind the scenes, similar to the kitchen, to interpret and fulfill requests.
- Users receive the results of their requests, just like receiving ordered food.
