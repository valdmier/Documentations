## Who are stakeholders?

A **stakeholder** is defined as an individual or group that has an interest in any decision or activity of an organization. A big part of what you’ll do as a security analyst is report your findings to various security stakeholders.

## Levels of stakeholders

There are many levels of stakeholders within larger organizations. As an entry-level analyst, you might only communicate directly with a few of them. Although you might not communicate with all of the security stakeholders in an organization, it’s important to have an understanding of who key stakeholders are:

- A **Chief Information Security Officer, also known as the CISO**, is the highest level of security stakeholder. You are unlikely to communicate directly with this stakeholder as an entry-level analyst. 

- A **Chief Financial Officer, also known as the CFO**, is another high-level stakeholder that you’re unlikely to communicate with directly.

- An operations manager oversees the day-to-day security operations. These individuals lead teams related to the development and implementation of security strategies that protect an organization from cyber threats.

- A cybersecurity risk manager is a professional responsible for leading efforts to identify, assess, and mitigate security risks within an organization.

CFOs and CISOs are focused on the big picture, like the potential financial burden of a security incident, whereas other roles like operations managers are more focused on the impact on day-to-day operations. Although you will rarely interact directly with high-level security stakeholders, it’s still important to recognize their relevance.
