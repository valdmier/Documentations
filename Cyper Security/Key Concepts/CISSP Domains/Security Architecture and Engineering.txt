Security Architecture and Engineering:

Focused on optimizing data security by ensuring effective tools, systems and processes are in place to protect and organization's asset and data. 

it includes:

 Ensuring the effectiveness of:

- Tools 
- Systems
- Processes


ne of the core concepts of secure design architecture is shared responsibility.

===

Shared responsibility:

means that all individuals within an organization take an active role in lowering risk and maintaining both physical and virtual security.

By having policies that encourage users to recognize and report security concerns, many issues can be handled quickly and effectively.


Shared responsibility means all individuals involved take an active role in lowering risk during the design of a security system. Additional design principles related to this domain, which are discussed later in the program, include:

- Threat modeling

- Least privilege

- Defense in depth

- Fail securely

- Separation of duties

- Keep it simple

- ero trust

- Trust but verify

An example of managing data is the use of a security information and event management (SIEM) tool to monitor for flags related to unusual login or user activity that could indicate a threat actor is attempting to access private data.
