Communication and network security:

 is mainly focused on managing and securing physical networks and wireless communications.


Secure networks keep an organization's data and communications safe whether on-site, or in the cloud, or when connecting to services remotely.

For example, employees working remotely in public spaces need to be protected from vulnerabilities that can occur when they use insecure bluetooth connections or public wifi hotspots.

 By having security team members remove access to those types of communication channels at the organizational level, employees may be discouraged from practicing insecure behavior that could be exploited by threat actors.
